	~	We create sub-ranges of All Fuels that match each sector's set of fuels \
		and map these sub-ranges to that sector, to simplify some equations.  (We \
		can't use the sub-ranges directly within each sector, as the ALLOCATE \
		AVAILABLE() function isn't compatible with sub-ranges.)  We don't have a \
		sub-range for the Electricity Sector fuels right now, because All Fuels \
		consolidates solar PV and solar thermal into "solar," onshore wind and \
		offshore wind into "wind," and natural gas nonpeaker and natural gas \
		peaker into "natural gas," and we need a one-to-one correspondance to do \
		subscript mapping.  If these three fuel types are in the future separated \
		into two categories in All Fuels, then a sub-range and mapping can be \
		added for the Electricity Sector at that time.

		of flexibility points used last year is zero, then we likely are dealing \
		with one of the electricity sources that doesn't require flexibility \
		points, so we shouldn't curtail it.  (2) We use a MAX(0) because we cannot \
		allow negative curtailment, and the curtailment function may result in \
		negative numbers for some values of FP usage between 0% and 100%.  (3) If \
		the fraction of flexibility points used is between 0% and 100%, we apply \
		the curtailment function directly.  However, if the FP use is over 100%, \
		we always allow a minimum amount of dispatch- the amount that would be \
		allowed by the available FP, given by the term 1-ZIDZ(1/fraction of FP \
		used).  This is because the curtailment function is typically second- or \
		third-order and would result in unrealistically high curtailment at very \
		high multiples of available FP use if it were uncapped.

		possible shifts (petroleum gasoline to biofuel gasoline, petroleum \
		gasoline to electricity, and biofuel gasoline to electricity).  In \
		practice, biofuel gasoline is hardly used by plug-in hybrids, and \
		electricity will always be the more economical choice for satisfying an \
		LCFS via generation of carbon-free energy.  Therefore, we only allow for \
		one of these three types of shifts in plug-in hybrids: petroleum gasoline \
		to electricity.  Accordingly, we must subtract out the (small) quantity by \
		which biofuels could be increased in plug-in hybrids when calculating the \
		total amount of potential increase in biofuels, to avoid exceeding the \
		maximum allowable shift in gasoline or diesel vehicles (when the shift is \
		assigned to those vehicles, rather than to plug-in hybrids, later in the \
		calculation steps).

	~	Buildings sector subsidies and rebates are given to energy-supplying cash \
		flow entities in proportion to the share of the modeled region's buildings \
		owned by these entities.  Energy-supplying entities likely own buildings \
		in proportion to their total energy production, not just their energy \
		production as used by the buildings sector.  But this variable is \
		subscripted by Building Fuel, which would prevent it being used for \
		handling these rebates and subsidies.  These rebates and subsidies are \
		extremely minor due to the vanishingly small share of all buildings that \
		are owned by energy-supplying entities, so it is not worth building \
		complex new structure to handle this.  Instead, we simply assign the \
		subsidies and rebates to Building Fuels in proportion to the usage of \
		those fuels in buildings.  Although this likely significantly \
		under-estimates the share of petroleum in oil-exporting countries, it \
		nonetheless is more than accurate enough for us here, because the \
		subsidies and rebates are tiny, and we mostly simply want to account for \
		them in order to have conservation of cash flows and avoid warnings on the \
		Debugging Assistance sheet.

	~	We use a SMOOTHI function to even out price spikes that unrealistically \
		affect the price of electricity, because the costs of construction of new \
		generation assets really would be spread out over a few years.  We use an \
		initial value of zero (and SMOOTHI rather than SMOOTH) because prior to \
		the start of the model run, the change in construction costs due to \
		policies is zero (none were in effect).  If we do not, then the first year \
		has a strongly negative change in construction cost that then affects all \
		the prices down the line and pulls them down in an unrealistic way.  The \
		curve with an initial value of zero is much closer to the original \
		(unsmoothed) curve than SMOOTH with no initial value.

	~	These equations are complicated because we need to apply an efficiency \
		adjustment when fuels shift between electricity and a non-electricity \
		fuel.  We first remove all the fuels that are being shifted (including \
		some that may be staying the same), then we add in all the fuels \
		reallocated to their target fuel types.  When the target fuel is \
		electricity, we apply an efficiency adjustment to all of the added fuels, \
		and then we undo the adjustment for electricitiy that was "shifted" to \
		electricity (i.e. stayed the same).  When the target fuel is not \
		electricity, we add all of the fuels without an efficiency adjustment, and \
		then we add additional fuel to the target fuel if the source fuel was \
		electricity to make the efficiency adjustment.  If you are having trouble \
		understanding these equations, first make sure you understand the simpler \
		examples of fuel shifting code that don't involve electricity efficiency \
		adjustments, which can be found in the calculated variables immediately \
		downstream of the following two input variables: hydgn/RHPF and indst/RIFF.

LDVs Feebate Rate=
	0
	~	Dmnl [0,1]
	~	The feebate is set as a fraction of the global best practice feebate rate.  The \
		global best practice feebate rate is $2000 per (hundredth gal/mile), which \
		equates to a $2000 fee on an LDV that gets 20 mpg if the pivot point is 25 \
		mpg.  (To see this: 20 mpg is 0.04 gpm.  25 mpg is 0.05 gpm.  The \
		difference is -.01 gpm.  So in order to levy a $2000 fee on the 20 mpg car \
		when the pivot point is 25 mpg, we need a rate of $2000/.01 gpm.)  The \
		feebate rate is designated in gpm rather than mpg because this provides \
		the same monetary incentive to save a gallon of fuel for all LDVs, despite \
		their different efficiencies.  That is, given a fixed number of miles \
		driven, reducing gpm by 0.01 will save the same quantity of fuel for any \
		car.  Given a fixed number of miles driven, increasing mpg by 0.01 will \
		save different amounts of fuel in different cars, depending on their \
		starting efficiencies.
		
		We're assuming the pivot point is adjusted to always maintain revenue \
		neutrality (no net cost to government or consumers).  This policy lever \
		only applies to passenger LDVs due to a lack of data on feebate effects on \
		other vehicle types.  The policy does not increase the efficiency of \
		battery electric LDVs, as it is assumed that they are already sufficiently \
		fuel-efficient to receive any potential benefits of the feebate, so the \
		feebate would not incentivize further fuel efficiency improvements in this \
		type of LDV.

	~	These equations are complicated because we need to apply an efficiency \
		adjustment when fuels shift between electricity and a non-electricity \
		fuel.  We first remove all the fuels that are being shifted (including \
		some that may be staying the same), then we add in all the fuels \
		reallocated to their target fuel types.  When the target fuel is \
		electricity, we apply an efficiency adjustment to all of the added fuels, \
		and then we undo the adjustment for electricitiy that was "shifted" to \
		electricity (i.e. stayed the same).  When the target fuel is not \
		electricity, we add all of the fuels without an efficiency adjustment, and \
		then we add additional fuel to the target fuel if the source fuel was \
		electricity to make the efficiency adjustment.  If you are having trouble \
		understanding these equations, first make sure you understand the simpler \
		examples of fuel shifting code that don't involve electricity efficiency \
		adjustments, which can be found in the calculated variables immediately \
		downstream of the following two input variables: hydgn/RHPF and indst/RIFF.

	~	Here is the purpose for each check in this variable.  (1) If the fraction \
		of flexibility points used last year is zero, then we likely are dealing \
		with one of the electricity sources that doesn't require flexibility \
		points, so we shouldn't curtail it.  (2) We use a MAX(0) because we cannot \
		allow negative curtailment, and the curtailment function may result in \
		negative numbers for some values of FP usage between 0% and 100%.  (3) If \
		the fraction of flexibility points used is between 0% and 100%, we apply \
		the curtailment function directly.  However, if the FP use is over 100%, \
		we always allow a minimum amount of dispatch- the amount that would be \
		allowed by the available FP, given by the term 1-ZIDZ(1/fraction of FP \
		used).  This is because the curtailment function is typically second- or \
		third-order and would result in unrealistically high curtailment at very \
		high multiples of available FP use if it were uncapped.

	~	This policy represents a reduction in demand for non-energy, \
		non-agriculture industrial outputs.  It can be used to represent policies \
		such as (1) material-efficient building codes reducing the amount of \
		concrete or steel in buildings, (2) requirements for improved durability \
		or longevity of products, so they are replaced less often, (3) more re-use \
		of products or intensification of use, such as more car sharing instead of \
		people owning their own cars, (4) water efficiency or waste reduction, \
		etc.  Since energy demand is determined elsewhere in the model (through \
		the demand sectors and energy imports/exports), this policy cannot be used \
		on energy industries (natural gas and petroleum systems, coal mining).  As \
		the "chemicals" industry includes pharmaceuticals (grouped in the same \
		ISIC code), and financial impacts tend to be dominated by pharmaceuticals \
		(which are not amenable to material efficiency or re-use strategies), we \
		disallow the use of this policy on the "chemicals" industry, to avoid \
		erroneous financial impacts.  We similarly disallow the use of the policy \
		on the "other industries" category because it is too highly aggregated, \
		and actual material efficiency or re-use policies would only affect \
		certain industries within that category, so financial impacts would not be \
		right if applied to "other industries" as a whole.  As of 2.0.0, the \
		policy assumes demand from all purchasers (government,industry, consumers, \
		and foreign entities) is reduced proportionately to the amount of goods \
		they buy, and it does not have any implementation cost for the policy \
		itself, beyond the financial consequences of the demand reduction.  A \
		separate lever handles shifting agricultural demand from animal products \
		to non-animal products, which is the main potential mechanism of demand \
		reduction for agricultural products.

		example, natural gas plants built during the model run may be more and \
		more efficient if they are built in later and later years.  The properties \
		of the average natural gas plant built during the model run define the \
		properties of the "newly built" quality level for natural gas plants.  \
		This may be a weighted average of different underlying technologies, like \
		combined cycle, combustion turbine, etc.  This may have the effect of \
		overstating the performance of plants built early in the model run and \
		understating the performance of plants built late in the model run, but it \
		is more feasible from a model standpoint than tracking each annual cohort \
		of power plants individually (with its own set of values for each input \
		variable that defines its properties).

		possible shifts (petroleum gasoline to biofuel gasoline, petroleum \
		gasoline to electricity, and biofuel gasoline to electricity).  In \
		practice, biofuel gasoline is hardly used by plug-in hybrids, and \
		electricity will always be the more economical choice for satisfying an \
		LCFS via generation of carbon-free energy.  Therefore, we only allow for \
		one of these three types of shifts in plug-in hybrids: petroleum gasoline \
		to electricity.  Accordingly, we must subtract out the (small) quantity by \
		which biofuels could be increased in plug-in hybrids when calculating the \
		total amount of potential increase in biofuels, to avoid exceeding the \
		maximum allowable shift in gasoline or diesel vehicles (when the shift is \
		assigned to those vehicles, rather than to plug-in hybrids, later in the \
		calculation steps).

		producers foresignt to BAU RPS values in years when the additional RPS \

The LCFS calculation (and policy lever setting) refer only to the fuel used by regulated vehicle types (as specified by the model adapter in an input variable), after adjustment for the efficiency of use of electricity.  Hence, we calculate the various LCFS metrics here, as the ratio of carbon free energy to all energy that meets these two conditions.

SoCDTtiNTY values for each vehicle/cargo type combination should typically be found via calibration.  After all other Transportation Sector data are in place, adjust the values of SoCDTtiNTY so as to eliminate abrupt changes in the variable "Retiring Vehicles" at the years corresponding to vehicle lifetimes.

We estimate start year fuel use (that is, one year before the first simulated year) by calculating it using data from the first simulated year.  This saves us the burden of calculating it in Excel and providing it as input data, and it prevents discontinuities as the model switches over from the provided value to a value calculated from the properties of the fleet.

To calibrate a vehicle type with a lifetime longer than the model run, such as rail, temporarily extend the model run by changing FINAL TIME to a farther-out value, such as 2060.  Perform the calibration, then restore FINAL TIME to its former value (2050).

Separately-regulated pollutants are non-CO2 combustion byproducts whose emissions are limited by law, such as a limit on NOx emissions per kilometer.  Improving fuel efficiency causes less fuel to be burned per kilometer, but it may not reduce emissions of NOx per kilometer.  Vehicle manufacturers design vehicles to meet fuel economy and conventional pollutant standards separately and may narrowly comply with each standard.  So, if fuel economy improves, the vehicle manufacturer may allow more NOx to be emitted per gram of gasoline burned, to keep the NOx rate per kilometer just under the standard.  We assume that separately-regulated pollutants are unaffected by changes in fuel economy, while other pollutants increase or decrease in proportion to changes in fuel economy.

If you are in a hurry and do not wish to calibrate every vehicle/cargo/tech combination, you can give all technologies (within a specific vehicle/cargo combination) the same SoCDTtiNTY value.  In this case, eliminate abrupt changes in "Retiring Vehicles Summed Across Technologies" rather than in "Retiring Vehicles."

All changes in revenue and expenditures here should be due to changes in domestic vehicles.  Changes in revenue or expenditure from selling vehicles for export is handled in the Industry sector, where vehicle suppliers are lumped into the "other industries" category.  For this reason, FoVObE should assign no vehicles to Foreign Entities.

The portion of non-energy industries' revenue going to labor (e.g. payments to their workers), to taxes (e.g. sales taxes on their products and corporate and worker income taxes), and to foreign entities (e.g. if the non-energy goods were purchased from abroad rather than from a domestic company) are separated out after the change in nonenergy industry revenue has been totaled across sectors.  Taxes on fuel/energy and special policy lever-driven taxes (and subsidies) are handled here.

A "flexibility point" is a quantity of flexibility on the grid (provided by any combination of dispatchable generation, storage, and demand response) that enables the grid to support BOTH one MW of wind and one MW of solar.  We allow each flexibility point to support both generation types because wind and solar tend to be in need of support/backup at different times of the day and so can use the same flexibility resources.

The RPS ensures enough potential electricity output from RPS-qualifying sources is available.  The RPS does not explicitly affect dispatch, because the contract-based dispatch ought to take priority (and if high enough, is allowed to violate the RPS), and thereafter, the renewables ought to be dispatched first under least cost dispatch anyway, due to their low marginal cost

Electricity suppliers approach whichever future-year RPS target produces the highest slope in the current year, so as to minimize the slope of increases in future years.  (This method produces the lowest maximum slope, minimizing the shock to electricity producers.)

If all such slopes are negative (i.e. all future RPS targets are below the surviving RPS-qualifying percentage), the minimum RPS-qualifying percentage sought will drop over time, but this will not matter, as no significant amount of RPS-qualifying resources are likely to retire during the model run.

All support services (demand response, grid batteries, electric vehicles, and transmission capacity across the modeled region border) that can support the grid in one part of the modeled region may not be able to support the grid in a different part of the modeled region, subject to transmission constraints.  Hence, the available peak reduction services from all of these resources are limited by the transmission connectivity coefficient.

When determining the share of demand that can be met from surviving RPS-qualifying sources, we use the surviving sources' expected electricity output, which is based on their expected capacity factors.  We can't use their actual output this year because dispatch calculations are handled later in the calculation flow.  If the model thinks the RPS is satisfied but is not dispatching enough RPS-qualifying sources to meet the RPS, either adjust the expected capacity factors of RPS-qualifying sources, or adjust the dispatch settings (such as eliminating guaranteed dispatch for fossil plants that may crowd out RE).

Decommissioning costs for power plants are calculated (see the Electricity Supply - Cash Flow tab), but they are intentionally excluded from the calculation that determines what plant types to build, reflecting the fact that real-world utilities disregard these decades-distant, end-of-life costs when choosing what new plant types to build.

We calculate potential capacity retirements based on whether the dispatch cost of those plant types rises relative to the mean, relative to the BAU case.  This causes retirements of technologies like coal or natural gas as the mean cost of production declines, as more renewables come onto the system.

We disallow early economic retirement of technologies whose cost is below the average in the current year, even if they are farther below the mean price in the BAU case than they are in the policy case.  (This prevents a situation where the mean declines because lots of cheap renewables go on the grid, causing cheap sources like solar or wind to retire because they are becoming less-cheap relative to the mean in the policy case than they were in the BAU case.)

If the fuel shift involves no capital cost (i.e. it's a drop-in fuel replacement, not a retrofit), we only compare the dispatch costs.  If it is a retrofit, we also check to ensure the plant type being retrofitted TO is not uneconomic, because it would be unlikely for a utility to secure financing and retrofit a plant to a type that's going to lose money (even if the loss rate is slower than the pre-retrofit loss rate).  Instead of paying for the retrofit, they'd likely build a plant type that will not lose money.

All support services (demand response, grid batteries, electric vehicles, and transmission capacity across the modeled region border) that can support the grid in one part of the modeled region may not be able to support the grid in a different part of the modeled region, subject to transmission constraints.  Hence, the available peak reduction services from all of these resources are limited by the transmission connectivity coefficient.

This page calculates changes in cash flows due to spending by the electricity sector, including on constructing new generation, buying fuel, OM, building transmission, etc.  It also calculates changes in electricity prices, for use on the "Fuels" sheet.  This sheet does not calculate cash flow impacts of changes in electricity sales, because those are handled on the cash flow pages of the various electricity-demanding sectors.

In this case, electricity suppliers are paying other electricity suppliers, so we don't recognize cash flow changes by entity.  (Broken-out industries are not restricted to the modeled region's borders.)  We do add the Change in Amount Spend on Importing Electricity to the Change in Total Outlays and Change in Capital Labor and Fuel Expenditures metrics, however.

The portion of non-energy industries' revenue going to labor (e.g. payments to their workers), to taxes (e.g. sales taxes on their products and corporate and worker income taxes), and to foreign entities (e.g. if the non-energy goods were purchased from abroad rather than from a domestic company) are separated out after the change in nonenergy industry revenue has been totaled across sectors.  Taxes on fuel/energy and special policy lever-driven taxes (and subsidies) are handled here.

Note that the "heating" building component refers to heating of air.  Water heaters are part of the "appliances" component in this model, as they are unaffected by the building envelope, whereas the "envelope" component influences the energy use of "heating" and "cooling and ventilation" components.

In order to compare the cost of running building components that serve the same buildings with the same fuel, we need to calculate a hypothetical energy use quantity in the BAU case, if the fuel shifting policy (and no other policy) had applied to that case.  Otherwise, we see large increases in cost per unit services for components using the target fuel (most commonly electricity) and large drops for other components, which is wrong, as it would be interpreting a fuel shift as fuel increases and decreases at the same service levels.

SoCEUtiNTY values for each component/building type combination should typically be found via calibration.  After all other Buildings Sector data are in place, adjust the values of SoCEUtiNTY so as to eliminate abrupt changes in the variable "Retiring Components Potential Energy Use Summed Across Fuels" at the years corresponding to component lifetimes.

Although this variable is not used in calculations on this sheet, it is used in calculations on other sheets, and it relies on an input data file (BDEQ) used for another variable on this sheet, so this variable must be placed here.

Note that for greater accuracy, it would be necessary to know how many years early components are replaced due to retrofitting, then to subtract out the energy use of the replaced components BOTH from new and from retiring components energy use in that year, because the component isn't being replaced in that year anymore, as it was replaced earlier.  In practice, these subtractions largely cancel each other out, and it's hard to find data on the number of years early that components would be replaced, so we simplify by not including this interaction.

Exogenous GDP energy use adjustment is introduced after the correction factor to avoid throwing off the correction factor calculations.  It effectively reduces energy use but not the purchase of new building components, similar to the effect of price-demand feedbacks.

Since input BCEU data may not be perfectly in sync with input lifetime (CL) data, to make our calculated BAU case components energy use match the input data, we use a correction factor.  The correction factor is calculated in Vensim and should be small if your BCEU and CL data are accurate and well-aligned with each other.  Larger discrepencies between data in BCEU and CL will result in a larger correction factor.

The portion of non-energy industries' revenue going to labor (e.g. payments to their workers), to taxes (e.g. sales taxes on their products and corporate and worker income taxes), and to foreign entities (e.g. if the non-energy goods were purchased from abroad rather than from a domestic company) are separated out after the change in nonenergy industry revenue has been totaled across sectors.  Taxes on fuel/energy and special policy lever-driven taxes (and subsidies) are handled here.

The portion of non-energy industries' revenue going to labor (e.g. payments to their workers), to taxes (e.g. sales taxes on their products and corporate and worker income taxes), and to foreign entities (e.g. if the non-energy goods were purchased from abroad rather than from a domestic company) are separated out after the change in nonenergy industry revenue has been totaled across sectors.  Taxes on fuel/energy and special policy lever-driven taxes (and subsidies) are handled here.

This includes cash flow changes to energy suppliers due to changes in their purchases of non-energy products stemming from overall changes in production of non-energy products.  This is calculated based on purchasing ISIC code, which doesn't separate out the energy suppliers, so we can't assign these cash flows to particular energy suppliers, so we leave them assigned to the correct energy industry ISIC codes.

Industries adjust the prices of their goods to reflect policy-driven changes in the amount they must pay to produce those goods (due to such things as carbon and fuel taxes (increasing costs), efficiency standards (increasing equipment costs, decreasing fuel costs), etc.  We do NOT pass through changes in expenditures due to changes in production, because an industry that spends less on buying input steel because it is producing fewer output products can't make the output products cheaper due to buying less steel.  That's already accounted for in the fact that there are fewer output products.

We annualize abatement from avoidance of large one-time carbon releases (deforestation, peat fires) over the time required for the forest or peatland to regenerate after a major carbon release.  This avoids unrealistic, spiky results and also allows the associated policies to be treated in a way consistent with other land use sector policies (except improved forest management).

We must include a one-step delay before calculating costs and fuel use to power CCS, as electricity is one of the fuels that can power CCS (in the Industry sector), and this influences electricity demand, which influences "Electricity Sector Pollutant Emissions before CCS," used here to help calculate sequestration from electric sector generation types.  (Note that Vensim incorrectly fails to generate a "Simultaneous Equation" error in the Policy (non-BAU) version of this loop, but it is actually circular in both the BAU and non-BAU structures.)

Changes in crude exports due to changes in secondary production should not be apportioned into changes in crude production or crude imports, because the crude that was formerly being used to make secondary products is now being exported instead.  Therefore, we subtract out any change in crude exports due to changes in secondary production.

This is not the cost to produce a unit of fuel.  This is the total change in costs for each fuel supplier, divided among the units of fuel that supplier produces, so that supplier can recover his/her actual costs by charging more for each unit of fuel they sell in the policy case.  This is why all changes in expenditures (including changes in expenditures due to changes in production) are included here and are divided only by the policy case fuel production, without using the BAU case fuel production.

Revenue for fuel, equipment, or labor provided to the modeled region's sectors (transportation, electricity, buildings, industry, district heat, hydrogen, etc.) is not export revenue, as the sectors represent activitiy within the modeled region.  Changes in export revenue in the EPS only come from the industry sector (where more or fewer non-energy goods can be sold to foreign entities) and in the fuels sector (where more or fewer fuels and electricity can be exported).

This section calculates the change of revenue for fuel-supplying entities attributable to each fuel type they produce.  This is done to allocate revenue changes for fuel suppliers to ISIC codes in the I/O model, as the ISIC codes don't map neatly onto the cash flow entities (but can be mapped neatly onto the fuel types).

"Requirements" variables refer to the number of jobs, amount of added value, or earnings in each industry that is required to produce a particular level of output by a particular industry.  If you have a known change in output level of a particular industry (e.g. caused by policy, elsewhere in the EPS), you can multiply this by a requirements variable to determine how many jobs, added value, or earnings were required (created) in order to provide that incremental output.

Here, we account for the economic activity generated by changes in spending by government and by households (labor and consumers).  If we had domestic policies that influenced foreign spending on domestically-produced, non-fuel industrial goods, that change in spending would need to be factored in here also.  (Changes in fuel exports are already accounted for in change in domestic fuel production.)

The Domestic Leontief Inverse Matrix filters out spending spent on foreign goods/services insofar as respending and cash flows between ISIC codes.  It expects an input that is the direct change in output for domestic ISIC codes (that is, it won't reduce the direct changes in output it receives to eliminate a foreign share), so we must do that as a separate step here.  (Conversely, a "Total" or "Global" Leontief Inverse Matrix does not filter respending flows and requires a total (not just domestic) change in output as its input.)

Our Input-Output table data are based on a single historical year - we don't have projected future time-series values for BAU jobs, value added, or EE compensation disaggregated by ISIC code.  Prior to this step, only the policy effects are time-series.  We produce time-series BAU values and policy case totals below, by apportioning time-series totals using the historical ISIC code percentage breakdowns.  This captures overall growth or shrinkage of the economy, and the relative differences in growth between employee compensation and number of employees, but it does not capture changes in the relative importance of different ISIC codes that occur over time in the BAU case.  If we obtain time-series jobs, value added, or employee compensation projections by ISIC code in the future, this would improve accuracy.

We are calculating the impacts on suppliers of the industries that are boosted by the policies, so the boosted industry is the target industry, and the indirect or induced impacts are on each source (supplier) industry.  This is why each industry here (and in "Induced Effects" below) is subscripted by "Source ISIC Code" rather than "Target ISIC Code".

Government and household respending (induced effects) use change in cash flow, not change in revenue, because they don't have all the change in revenue available to respend (i.e. they may have already spent some of it in Change in Expenditures).

For industry, we use change in revenue, not change in cash flow, because output (production) is linked to revenue, not net income.

Even the fuel industries need the foreign share of revenue taken out here.  The fuel trade code on the "Fuels" page adds revenue for fuel exports and adds expenditures for fuel imports, but we use revenues here (not cash flows), so any change in import expenditures hasn't been removed from the revenue used here.

Expenses passed through to buyers (such as raising the price of a good by the amount of a tax levied on that good) don't increase output for employment (or employee compensation) purposes.  You don't need more workers because you're not making more products.  Therefore, we remove industry's revenue from passthrough costs from industry's contribution to output.  (For calculation of value added, we will add the passthrough costs back in later, because taxes and employee compensation paid are a part of value added and contribute to GDP.)

We did not reassign any share of the change in industries' output (revenue) to government (for taxes) or to labor and consumers (for workforce payments) in front of the IO model.  Therefore, we need to use the full impacts of the change in output on government and labor cash flow (as calculated by the IO model) to feed into the IO model in the next timestep.  That is, we don't want to limit the change in ouptut used here to indirect effects.

Exception: the change in fuel industry revenue was already reduced by the change in taxes on fuels, and the resulting change in tax revenue was already assigned to government.

The change in output by industry is the source of these macro outputs.  We don't want to feed back the residual change in industry output into the IO model, because that would be double-counting this industry change in revenue.  We only want the macro changes in government and household cash flows to feed back in.

It is okay that direct changes in government or household cash flow create further changes via this feedback.  For instance, imagine a policy that increases household income (suppose, via a tax cut funded by deficit spending).  Households buy more goods, which leads to more employment and employee compensation, which further increases household cash flow and spending.

In the IO model, indirect impact on value added includes passthrough expenses, because taxes and employee compensation contribute to GDP.  However, a tax that is passed through doesn't increase output, so it should not affect value added when it is used in a feedback loop that adjusts energy service demand.  Therefore, we calculate a special version of indirect impacts on value added here that excludes passthrough costs.

In other words, this feedback is the replacement for partitioning out the government and labor portions of cash flows for industries ahead of the I/O model (which we do not do).  Industry already had its portion fed through the I/O model, but government and labor have not, hence the feedback.

Carbon taxes are levied upstream on fuel sales, before it is known whether a unit of fuel will be burned with or without CCS.  So the government must pay CCS providers back for the tax they already paid (capitalized into the cost of their fuels).  Also, CCS providers might sell their CCS services on a market for credits.  So carbon tax rebates are distinct rebate payments (which we classify as subsidies), not a reduction in tax.

Changes in purchases of non-energy input materials (e.g. raw steel, etc.) are also a part of OpEx, but at present, we don't separate out input materials from other industrial products - we only have the total change in expenditures on all industrial products in variable "Changes in Nonenergy Expenditures by Entity due to Production Changes."  Including this entire variable in the cost metric tends to overwhelm other components of the cost metric when material efficiency policies are enabled.  For now, we exclude changes in spending on input materials from the CapEx + OpEx metric.  We may revisit this in a future EPS update.

This variable is no longer used in the cost metric (because we now subtract out the portion of government revenue change allocated to tax reduction/rebates for revenue neutrality, instead of assuming the total of every tax and subsidy is revenue-neutral), but we leave the calculations here in case they are useful later.

Energy-related emissions are all anthropogenic emissions from within the borders of the modeled region except industrial process emissions and anthropogenic LULUCF emissions.  Energy-related emissions captured by CCS do not count as emissions (i.e. we only include net energy-related emissions here).  However, emissions from fuel burned in the geoengineering sector are energy-related emissions, but CO2 captured from the atmosphere (DAC) does not count as negative energy-related emissions.

Whether or not policies are ENABLED, all changes in revenues and expenditures for non-energy industries should be identical to those values when divided by ISIC Code.  Up to about +/- $1 million variance (maybe more with some policy packages) is to be expected due to limitations on accuracy of floating point calculations in Vensim.
