	~	Plug-in hybrids can shift to either electricity or biofuels.  To model \
		this explicitly would be very difficult, as we'd need to account for three \
		possible shifts (petroleum gasoline to biofuel gasoline, petroleum \
		gasoline to electricity, and biofuel gasoline to electricity).  In \
		practice, biofuel gasoline is hardly used by plug-in hybrids, and \
		electricity will always be the more economical choice for satisfying an \
		LCFS via generation of carbon-free energy.  Therefore, we only allow for \
		one of these three types of shifts in plug-in hybrids: petroleum gasoline \
		to electricity.  Accordingly, we must subtract out the (small) quantity by \
		which biofuels could be increased in plug-in hybrids when calculating the \
		total amount of potential increase in biofuels, to avoid exceeding the \
		maximum allowable shift in gasoline or diesel vehicles (when the shift is \
		assigned to those vehicles, rather than to plug-in hybrids, later in the \
		calculation steps).

	~	Buildings sector subsidies and rebates are given to energy-supplying cash \
		flow entities in proportion to the share of the modeled region's buildings \
		owned by these entities.  Energy-supplying entities likely own buildings \
		in proportion to their total energy production, not just their energy \
		production as used by the buildings sector.  But this variable is \
		subscripted by Building Fuel, which would prevent it being used for \
		handling these rebates and subsidies.  These rebates and subsidies are \
		extremely minor due to the vanishingly small share of all buildings that \
		are owned by energy-supplying entities, so it is not worth building \
		complex new structure to handle this.  Instead, we simply assign the \
		subsidies and rebates to Building Fuels in proportion to the usage of \
		those fuels in buildings.  Although this likely significantly \
		under-estimates the share of petroleum in oil-exporting countries, it \
		nonetheless is more than accurate enough for us here, because the \
		subsidies and rebates are tiny, and we mostly simply want to account for \
		them in order to have conservation of cash flows and avoid warnings on the \
		Debugging Assistance sheet.

	~	Reference fuels (petroleum gasoline, petroleum diesel, and jet fuel) have \
		carbon intensity ratios of 1.  When a non-reference transportation fuel \
		can be used by more than one type of vehicle (such as electricity, which \
		can be used by electric cars (LDVs) and electric buses (HDVs)), we \
		determine the carbon intensity ratio of that fuel based on the vehicle \
		type that most commonly uses that fuel (LDVs, in the case of electricity).

	~	These equations are complicated because we need to apply an efficiency \
		adjustment when fuels shift between electricity and a non-electricity \
		fuel.  We first remove all the fuels that are being shifted (including \
		some that may be staying the same), then we add in all the fuels \
		reallocated to their target fuel types.  When the target fuel is \
		electricity, we apply an efficiency adjustment to all of the added fuels, \
		and then we undo the adjustment for electricitiy that was "shifted" to \
		electricity (i.e. stayed the same).  When the target fuel is not \
		electricity, we add all of the fuels without an efficiency adjustment, and \
		then we add additional fuel to the target fuel if the source fuel was \
		electricity to make the efficiency adjustment.  If you are having trouble \
		understanding these equations, first make sure you understand the simpler \
		examples of fuel shifting code that don't involve electricity efficiency \
		adjustments, which can be found in the calculated variables immediately \
		downstream of the following two input variables: hydgn/RHPF and indst/RIFF.

LDVs Feebate Rate=
	0
	~	Dmnl [0,1]
	~	The feebate is set as a fraction of the global best practice feebate rate.  The \
		global best practice feebate rate is $2000 per (hundredth gal/mile), which \
		equates to a $2000 fee on an LDV that gets 20 mpg if the pivot point is 25 \
		mpg.  (To see this: 20 mpg is 0.04 gpm.  25 mpg is 0.05 gpm.  The \
		difference is -.01 gpm.  So in order to levy a $2000 fee on the 20 mpg car \
		when the pivot point is 25 mpg, we need a rate of $2000/.01 gpm.)  The \
		feebate rate is designated in gpm rather than mpg because this provides \
		the same monetary incentive to save a gallon of fuel for all LDVs, despite \
		their different efficiencies.  That is, given a fixed number of miles \
		driven, reducing gpm by 0.01 will save the same quantity of fuel for any \
		car.  Given a fixed number of miles driven, increasing mpg by 0.01 will \
		save different amounts of fuel in different cars, depending on their \
		starting efficiencies.
		
		We're assuming the pivot point is adjusted to always maintain revenue \
		neutrality (no net cost to government or consumers).  This policy lever \
		only applies to passenger LDVs due to a lack of data on feebate effects on \
		other vehicle types.  The policy does not increase the efficiency of \
		battery electric LDVs, as it is assumed that they are already sufficiently \
		fuel-efficient to receive any potential benefits of the feebate, so the \
		feebate would not incentivize further fuel efficiency improvements in this \
		type of LDV.

	~	These equations are complicated because we need to apply an efficiency \
		adjustment when fuels shift between electricity and a non-electricity \
		fuel.  We first remove all the fuels that are being shifted (including \
		some that may be staying the same), then we add in all the fuels \
		reallocated to their target fuel types.  When the target fuel is \
		electricity, we apply an efficiency adjustment to all of the added fuels, \
		and then we undo the adjustment for electricitiy that was "shifted" to \
		electricity (i.e. stayed the same).  When the target fuel is not \
		electricity, we add all of the fuels without an efficiency adjustment, and \
		then we add additional fuel to the target fuel if the source fuel was \
		electricity to make the efficiency adjustment.  If you are having trouble \
		understanding these equations, first make sure you understand the simpler \
		examples of fuel shifting code that don't involve electricity efficiency \
		adjustments, which can be found in the calculated variables immediately \
		downstream of the following two input variables: hydgn/RHPF and indst/RIFF.

	~	This policy represents a reduction in demand for non-energy, \
		non-agriculture industrial outputs.  It can be used to represent policies \
		such as (1) material-efficient building codes reducing the amount of \
		concrete or steel in buildings, (2) requirements for improved durability \
		or longevity of products, so they are replaced less often, (3) more re-use \
		of products or intensification of use, such as more car sharing instead of \
		people owning their own cars, (4) water efficiency or waste reduction, \
		etc.  Since energy demand is determined elsewhere in the model (through \
		the demand sectors and energy imports/exports), this policy cannot be used \
		on energy industries (natural gas and petroleum systems, coal mining).  As \
		the "chemicals" industry includes pharmaceuticals (grouped in the same \
		ISIC code), and financial impacts tend to be dominated by pharmaceuticals \
		(which are not amenable to material efficiency or re-use strategies), we \
		disallow the use of this policy on the "chemicals" industry, to avoid \
		erroneous financial impacts.  We similarly disallow the use of the policy \
		on the "other industries" category because it is too highly aggregated, \
		and actual material efficiency or re-use policies would only affect \
		certain industries within that category, so financial impacts would not be \
		right if applied to "other industries" as a whole.  As of 2.0.0, the \
		policy assumes demand from all purchasers (government,industry, consumers, \
		and foreign entities) is reduced proportionately to the amount of goods \
		they buy, and it does not have any implementation cost for the policy \
		itself, beyond the financial consequences of the demand reduction.  A \
		separate lever handles shifting agricultural demand from animal products \
		to non-animal products, which is the main potential mechanism of demand \
		reduction for agricultural products.

	~	Plug-in hybrids can shift to either electricity or biofuels.  To model \
		this explicitly would be very difficult, as we'd need to account for three \
		possible shifts (petroleum gasoline to biofuel gasoline, petroleum \
		gasoline to electricity, and biofuel gasoline to electricity).  In \
		practice, biofuel gasoline is hardly used by plug-in hybrids, and \
		electricity will always be the more economical choice for satisfying an \
		LCFS via generation of carbon-free energy.  Therefore, we only allow for \
		one of these three types of shifts in plug-in hybrids: petroleum gasoline \
		to electricity.  Accordingly, we must subtract out the (small) quantity by \
		which biofuels could be increased in plug-in hybrids when calculating the \
		total amount of potential increase in biofuels, to avoid exceeding the \
		maximum allowable shift in gasoline or diesel vehicles (when the shift is \
		assigned to those vehicles, rather than to plug-in hybrids, later in the \
		calculation steps).

		supplied by the fuel supplier who is receiving this revenue.  All types of \
		energy suppliers could conceivably own electric vehicles, but this \
		variable is subscripted by Transportation Fuel, and coal isn't a \
		transportation fuel, so we don't have an easy way to assign this money to \
		coal suppliers.  We could build a separate structure for this, but EV \
		rebates due to ownership of EVs by these companies is an extremely tiny \
		cash flow, so it is not worth the extra complexity.  Instead, we include \
		it in the same category as electricity suppliers, who are the main \

The LCFS calculation (and policy lever setting) refer only to the fuel used by regulated vehicle types (as specified by the model adapter in an input variable), after adjustment for the efficiency of use of electricity.  Hence, we calculate the various LCFS metrics here, as the ratio of carbon free energy to all energy that meets these two conditions.

SoCDTtiNTY values for each vehicle/cargo type combination should typically be found via calibration.  After all other Transportation Sector data are in place, adjust the values of SoCDTtiNTY so as to eliminate abrupt changes in the variable "Retiring Vehicles" at the years corresponding to vehicle lifetimes.

We estimate start year fuel use (that is, one year before the first simulated year) by calculating it using data from the first simulated year.  This saves us the burden of calculating it in Excel and providing it as input data, and it prevents discontinuities as the model switches over from the provided value to a value calculated from the properties of the fleet.

To calibrate a vehicle type with a lifetime longer than the model run, such as rail, temporarily extend the model run by changing FINAL TIME to a farther-out value, such as 2060.  Perform the calibration, then restore FINAL TIME to its former value (2050).

Separately-regulated pollutants are non-CO2 combustion byproducts whose emissions are limited by law, such as a limit on NOx emissions per kilometer.  Improving fuel efficiency causes less fuel to be burned per kilometer, but it may not reduce emissions of NOx per kilometer.  Vehicle manufacturers design vehicles to meet fuel economy and conventional pollutant standards separately and may narrowly comply with each standard.  So, if fuel economy improves, the vehicle manufacturer may allow more NOx to be emitted per gram of gasoline burned, to keep the NOx rate per kilometer just under the standard.  We assume that separately-regulated pollutants are unaffected by changes in fuel economy, while other pollutants increase or decrease in proportion to changes in fuel economy.

All changes in revenue and expenditures here should be due to changes in domestic vehicles.  Changes in revenue or expenditure from selling vehicles for export is handled in the Industry sector, where vehicle suppliers are lumped into the "other industries" category.

The portion of non-energy industries' revenue going to labor (e.g. payments to their workers), to taxes (e.g. sales taxes on their products and corporate and worker income taxes), and to foreign entities (e.g. if the non-energy goods were purchased from abroad rather than from a domestic company) are separated out after the change in nonenergy industry revenue has been totaled across sectors.  Taxes on fuel/energy and special policy lever-driven taxes (and subsidies) are handled here.

Decommissioning costs for power plants are calculated (see the Electricity Supply - Cash Flow tab), but they are intentionally excluded from the calculation that determines what plant types to build, reflecting the fact that real-world utilities disregard these decades-distant, end-of-life costs when choosing what new plant types to build.

We calculate revenue and cost in terms of electric output, not capacity, because this properly accounts for costs and income of plants that dispatch more or less.  For instance, petroleum plants have low cost per unit capacity because they hardly ever dispatch, but that doesn't make petroleum plants cost-effective to build.  They correctly have high cost per unit electricity output.  We convert to capacity at the end.

The Load Factor Hourly Variance Multiplier can increase or decrease the hourly variance in electricity demand to help adapt the load profiles in SHELF to match observed real-world properties (such as annual peak hour demand) in the modeled region. LFHVM does not change total demand, only how it is distributed by hour. Different multiplier values can be set by sector and by timeslice.

Fuel type shifting (without a retrofit) requires sub-annual time scale fuel prices to be done accurately, as when U.S. Northeast plants shift to burning petroleum in hours when natural gas is expensive.  The same unit, represented by a single row in the EIA spreadsheets, can burn either fuel.  We don't have the fuel price data with time resolution to model that, and it's not a crucial effect to capture, so we are leaving it out for now.

If guaranteed dispatch and the RPS policy conflict, the RPS policy takes precedence, so we reduce the amount of non-RPS-qualifying guaranteed dispatch such that the RPS can be met. We only restrict guaranteed dispatch when necessary to meet the legally required RPS percentage, not the RPS percentage with foresight, even if foresight is enabled.

Since some RPS-qualifying resources (such as nuclear) have non-zero dispatch costs, and it is possible for subsidized fossil plants to have zero or negative dispatch costs, we need a dispatch pass for RPS-qualifying resources ahead of the dispatch pass for zero- and negative-cost resources.

Currently, marginal capacity factors are calculated in such a way that they are identical to expected capacity factors, except for plant types in the "variable renewable electricity source" sub-range (i.e., wind and solar).  This seems to work well in terms of final model output.  But we might consider using some other approach for marginal capacity factors for the non-variable-renewable plant types in the future, if needed.

We want to use bid, not marginal, capacity factors in these three "potential RPS qualifying output" variables, as we limit the output later based on electricity demand, and we want to allow all capacity to potentially dispatch as much as it can before we impose the limit based on electricity demand.

In contrast to diurnal electricity storage, seasonal electricity storage is not broken out by technology, but can represent a mixture of technologies such as compressed air, thermal storage, etc. IEA reports grid batteries are only used for sub-hourly, hourly, and daily balancing, so no grid batteries should be included here.

Generally, a dispatchable or baseload plant type will have the same bid capacity factor in every hour. Solar and wind are classified as variable renewables and have bid capacity factors that vary by hour. There are some other plant types whose bid capacity factors vary by timeslice or hour (hydro, biomass, MSW). We want to account for any variance in available capacity, so we base the net peak calculations on overall spare capacity, not "demand minus wind and solar generation." This may differ from the definition of "net peak" in some sources, but it should produce essentially identical results in typical regions while producing better results in regions that make heavy use of hydro or seasonally-available biomass.

We need to work in aggregate units in these two steps (i.e., multiplying each timeslice by the number of days in that timeslice) because seasonal grid battery capacity is a single number that needs to be satisfied by charging across all days, so "average day" timeslices count more heavily than peak days for charging grid batteries, as they contain more days.

This code is meant to limit the total amount of an electricity source that can ever exist, such as by exhausting all available sites for hydroelectric dams.  This section should NOT be used to limit the amount of capacity that can be constructed in a given year due to such things as constraints on production rates due to available labor, capital, etc., which is handled via supply curves that escalate the cost of resources the more are built in the same year.

We intentionally avoid combining "Retiring Generation Capacity" and "Decreased Capacity from CCUS Retrofits" so they can be handled separately where needed, such as to avoid charging decommissioning costs on plants that are retrofit rather than retired.

"Decrease in Capacity from CCUS Retrofits" cannot be factored into "Surviving Capacity" without creating circularity, as unlike normal retirements, retrofit decisions aren't made until plant construction, which requires knowledge of surviving capacity. (Decreases in capacity due to retrofits are already factored into surviving capacity with a one-year delay by way of "Last Year Electricity Generation Capacity."

We need to work in aggregate units in these two steps (i.e., multiplying each timeslice by the number of days in that timeslice) because seasonal grid battery capacity is a single number that needs to be satisfied by charging across all days, so "average day" timeslices count more heavily than peak days for charging grid batteries, as they contain more days.

Hybrid power plant revenues are based on optimizing electricity discharge based on the prior year's discharging pattern. We calculate the share of daily electricity production that could be stored based on the battery size and assume these plant types can optimize all of their discharging during the highest priced periods, as estimated by the demand altering technology code.

If all such slopes are negative (i.e. all future RPS targets are below the surviving RPS-qualifying percentage), the minimum RPS-qualifying percentage sought will drop over time, but this will not matter, as no significant amount of RPS-qualifying resources are likely to retire during the model run.

We calculate revenue and cost in terms of electric output, not capacity, because this properly accounts for costs and income of plants that dispatch more or less.  For instance, petroleum plants have low cost per unit capacity because they hardly ever dispatch, but that doesn't make petroleum plants cost-effective to build.  They correctly have high cost per unit electricity output.  We convert to capacity at the end.

Fuel type shifting (without a retrofit) requires sub-annual time scale fuel prices to be done accurately, as when U.S. Northeast plants shift to burning petroleum in hours when natural gas is expensive.  The same unit, represented by a single row in the EIA spreadsheets, can burn either fuel.  We don't have the fuel price data with time resolution to model that, and it's not a crucial effect to capture, so we are leaving it out for now.

If guaranteed dispatch and the RPS policy conflict, the RPS policy takes precedence, so we reduce the amount of non-RPS-qualifying guaranteed dispatch such that the RPS can be met.

Since some RPS-qualifying resources (such as nuclear) have non-zero dispatch costs, and it is possible for subsidized fossil plants to have zero or negative dispatch costs, we need a dispatch pass for RPS-qualifying resources ahead of the dispatch pass for zero- and negative-cost resources.

In each hour, we dispatch all RPS-qualifying plants that we can without exceeding demand in that hour.  We do this because the upstream RPS code (which determines how much RPS capacity to build) assumes it will fully dispatch, so it must now do so in order to end up with the expected RPS percentage on an annual basis.

Currently, marginal capacity factors are calculated in such a way that they are identical to expected capacity factors, except for plant types in the "variable renewable electricity source" sub-range (i.e., wind and solar).  This seems to work well in terms of final model output.  But we might consider using some other approach for marginal capacity factors for the non-variable-renewable plant types in the future, if needed.

We want to use bid, not marginal, capacity factors in these three "potential RPS qualifying output" variables, as we limit the output later based on electricity demand, and we want to allow all capacity to potentially dispatch as much as it can before we impose the limit based on electricity demand.

Generally, a dispatchable or baseload plant type will have the same bid capacity factor in every hour. Solar and wind are classified as variable renewables and have bid capacity factors that vary by hour. There are some other plant types whose bid capacity factors vary by timeslice or hour (hydro, biomass, MSW). We want to account for any variance in available capacity, so we base the net peak calculations on overall spare capacity, not "demand minus wind and solar generation." This may differ from the definition of "net peak" in some sources, but it should produce essentially identical results in typical regions while producing better results in regions that make heavy use of hydro or seasonally-available biomass.

We need to work in aggregate units in these two steps (i.e., multiplying each timeslice by the number of days in that timeslice) because seasonal grid battery capacity is a single number that needs to be satisfied by charging across all days, so "average day" timeslices count more heavily than peak days for charging grid batteries, as they contain more days.

Hybrid power plant revenues are based on optimizing electricity discharge based on the prior year's discharging pattern. We calculate the share of daily electricity production that could be stored based on the battery size and assume these plant types can optimize all of their discharging during the highest priced periods, as estimated by the demand altering technology code.

We need to work in aggregate units in these two steps (i.e., multiplying each timeslice by the number of days in that timeslice) because seasonal grid battery capacity is a single number that needs to be satisfied by charging across all days, so "average day" timeslices count more heavily than peak days for charging grid batteries, as they contain more days.

This page calculates changes in cash flows due to spending by the electricity sector, including on constructing new generation, buying fuel, OM, building transmission, etc.  It also calculates changes in electricity prices, for use on the "Fuels" sheet.  This sheet does not calculate cash flow impacts of changes in electricity sales, because those are handled on the cash flow pages of the various electricity-demanding sectors.

In this case, electricity suppliers are paying other electricity suppliers, so we don't recognize cash flow changes by entity.  (Broken-out industries are not restricted to the modeled region's borders.)  We do add the Change in Amount Spend on Importing Electricity to the Change in Total Outlays and Change in Capital Labor and Fuel Expenditures metrics, however.

In the EPS, grid battery capacity is measured in MWh, not MW. Data sources sometimes provide battery capacity in MW. We use GBSC Diurnal Grid Battery Daily Storage Duration to convert from MW to MWh. It reflects how many hours per day the battery can be charging at its rated MW power before it fills up.

Here we calculate the changes in delivered electriicty costs. These costs include the wholseale electricity costs + transmission and distribution OM costs + transmission and distribution capital costs + battery storage capital costs + any CES/ZEC costs + any costs of adding new capacity for reliability + demand response costs + decommissioning costs. It is assumed that capital and OM costs for new and existing power plants and retrofits are recovered through energy and capacity market revenue. Batteries are treated as a system cost like T&D assets.

Ongoing capital costs only apply to surviving capacity, because new capacity is not expected to have ongoing costs in the year it is built. We do not smooth ongoing costs because the capital investments are assumed to be installed in the year they are required.

We assume that resources with guaranteed dispatch get cost recovery. They will still choose to retire based on market dynamics if they become uneconomic relative to the energy market. Costs for the energy market itself are only paid out to resources dispatched in the market. This refelcts the fact that in the real world, electricity suppliers are a mix of competitive independent power producers, without cost recovery, and utilities, which may have cost recovery.

In order to compare the cost of running building components that serve the same buildings with the same fuel, we need to calculate a hypothetical energy use quantity in the BAU case, if the fuel shifting policy (and no other policy) had applied to that case.  Otherwise, we see large increases in cost per unit services for components using the target fuel (most commonly electricity) and large drops for other components, which is wrong, as it would be interpreting a fuel shift as fuel increases and decreases at the same service levels.

Note that for greater accuracy, it would be necessary to know how many years early components are replaced due to retrofitting, then to subtract out the energy use of the replaced components BOTH from new and from retiring components energy use in that year, because the component isn't being replaced in that year anymore, as it was replaced earlier.  In practice, these subtractions largely cancel each other out, and it's hard to find data on the number of years early that components would be replaced, so we simplify by not including this interaction.

Three levers can impact distributed solar buildout (top to bottom). The first adds a subsidy for solar construction. The second mandates a specific amount of solar capacity to be built by a target year. These two levers are non additive, as a subsidy can be a way of making it more affordable for consumers to meet a solar mandate. The third lever ensures that (including the other two levers and any BAU solar builds) distributed solar meets a specific share of electricity demand in a year.

Since input BCEU data may not be perfectly in sync with input lifetime (CL) data, to make our calculated BAU case components energy use match the input data, we use a correction factor.  The correction factor is calculated in Vensim and should be small if your BCEU and CL data are accurate and well-aligned with each other.  Larger discrepencies between data in BCEU and CL will result in a larger correction factor.

The portion of non-energy industries' revenue going to labor (e.g. payments to their workers), to taxes (e.g. sales taxes on their products and corporate and worker income taxes), and to foreign entities (e.g. if the non-energy goods were purchased from abroad rather than from a domestic company) are separated out after the change in nonenergy industry revenue has been totaled across sectors.  Taxes on fuel/energy and special policy lever-driven taxes (and subsidies) are handled here.

The portion of non-energy industries' revenue going to labor (e.g. payments to their workers), to taxes (e.g. sales taxes on their products and corporate and worker income taxes), and to foreign entities (e.g. if the non-energy goods were purchased from abroad rather than from a domestic company) are separated out after the change in nonenergy industry revenue has been totaled across sectors.  Taxes on fuel/energy and special policy lever-driven taxes (and subsidies) are handled here.

This is calculated based on purchasing ISIC code, which doesn't separate out the energy suppliers, so we can't assign these cash flows to particular energy suppliers, so we leave them assigned to the correct energy industry ISIC codes.

Industries adjust the prices of their goods to reflect policy-driven changes in the amount they must pay to produce those goods (due to such things as carbon and fuel taxes (increasing costs), efficiency standards (increasing equipment costs, decreasing fuel costs), etc.  We do NOT pass through changes in expenditures due to changes in production, because an industry that spends less on buying input steel because it is producing fewer output products can't make the output products cheaper due to buying less steel.  That's already accounted for in the fact that there are fewer output products.

This variable excludes the effects of production changes on revenue, but it does not exclude every small effect from changes in production.  For example, some changes in CCS capital and OM costs are influenced by changes in production, and the full changes in CCS capital and OM costs are included in this variable.  The vast majority of production effects are being excluded.

We annualize abatement from avoidance of large one-time carbon releases (deforestation, peat fires) over the time required for the forest or peatland to regenerate after a major carbon release.  This avoids unrealistic, spiky results and also allows the associated policies to be treated in a way consistent with other land use sector policies (except improved forest management).

We must include a one-step delay before calculating costs and fuel use to power CCS, as electricity is one of the fuels that can power CCS (in the Industry sector), and this influences electricity demand, which influences "Electricity Sector Pollutant Emissions before CCS," used here to help calculate sequestration from electric sector generation types.  (Note that Vensim incorrectly fails to generate a "Simultaneous Equation" error in the Policy (non-BAU) version of this loop, but it is actually circular in both the BAU and non-BAU structures.)

Changes in crude exports due to changes in secondary production should not be apportioned into changes in crude production or crude imports, because the crude that was formerly being used to make secondary products is now being exported instead.  Therefore, we subtract out any change in crude exports due to changes in secondary production.

This is not the cost to produce a unit of fuel.  This is the total change in costs for each fuel supplier, divided among the units of fuel that supplier produces, so that supplier can recover his/her actual costs by charging more for each unit of fuel they sell in the policy case.  This is why all changes in expenditures (including changes in expenditures due to changes in production) are included here and are divided only by the policy case fuel production, without using the BAU case fuel production.

For each fuel, BAU in-region consumption should equal BAU production plus BAU imports minus BAU exports.  BAU consumption data is summed from the various sectors, which have the data with high granularity particular to each sector.  We ensure the equation holds by calculating one of the three other terms (production, imports, or exports), with the term to be calculated specified by input data (since this can vary by fuel and by modeled region).

Revenue for fuel, equipment, or labor provided to the modeled region's sectors (transportation, electricity, buildings, industry, district heat, hydrogen, etc.) is not export revenue, as the sectors represent activitiy within the modeled region.  Changes in export revenue in the EPS only come from the industry sector (where more or fewer non-energy goods can be sold to foreign entities) and in the fuels sector (where more or fewer fuels and electricity can be exported).

This section calculates the change of revenue for fuel-supplying entities attributable to each fuel type they produce.  This is done to allocate revenue changes for fuel suppliers to ISIC codes in the I/O model, as the ISIC codes don't map neatly onto the cash flow entities (but can be mapped neatly onto the fuel types).

An ideal VAT and Sales Tax would produce the same amount of government revenue, with the same tax burden ultimately falling on producers of each ISIC code.  It is just a difference of tax administration: where the tax is collected.  A VAT is collected at each step, and each downstream buyer pays a price that reimburses the supplier for the VAT it paid.  A sales tax is collected at the end, so a business would pay less to its suppliers, as it doesn't need to reimburse them for their VAT payments.

Therefore, we separate out changes in VAT or sales tax revenue from final industry revenue before putting final industry revenue into the I/O model (which expects after-VAT/ after-sales tax revenue impacts).  We don't concern ourselves with whether the tax was collected at each step or all at the end.  (We don't have access to Value Added info prior to the I/O model, and we need to separate the tax before reaching the I/O model, so we need to program it this way in any event.)

"Requirements" variables refer to the number of jobs, amount of added value, or earnings in each industry that is required to produce a particular level of output by a particular industry.  If you have a known change in output level of a particular industry (e.g. caused by policy, elsewhere in the EPS), you can multiply this by a requirements variable to determine how many jobs, added value, or earnings were required (created) in order to provide that incremental output.

Here, we account for the economic activity generated by changes in spending by government and by households (labor and consumers).  If we had domestic policies that influenced foreign spending on domestically-produced, non-fuel industrial goods, that change in spending would need to be factored in here also.  (Changes in fuel exports are already accounted for in change in domestic fuel production.)

The Domestic Leontief Inverse Matrix filters out spending spent on foreign goods/services insofar as respending and cash flows between ISIC codes.  It expects an input that is the direct change in output for domestic ISIC codes (that is, it won't reduce the direct changes in output it receives to eliminate a foreign share), so we must do that as a separate step here.  (Conversely, a "Total" or "Global" Leontief Inverse Matrix does not filter respending flows and requires a total (not just domestic) change in output as its input.)

We are calculating the impacts on suppliers of the industries that are boosted by the policies, so the boosted industry is the target industry, and the indirect or induced impacts are on each source (supplier) industry.  This is why each industry here (and in "Induced Effects" below) is subscripted by "Source ISIC Code" rather than "Target ISIC Code".

Even the fuel industries need the foreign share of revenue taken out here.  The fuel trade code on the "Fuels" page adds revenue for fuel exports and adds expenditures for fuel imports, but we use revenues here (not cash flows), so any change in import expenditures hasn't been removed from the revenue used here.

Expenses passed through to buyers (such as raising the price of a good by the amount of a tax levied on that good) don't increase output for employment (or employee compensation) purposes.  You don't need more workers because you're not making more products.  Therefore, we remove industry's revenue from passthrough costs from industry's contribution to output.  (For calculation of value added, we will add the passthrough costs back in later, because taxes and employee compensation paid are a part of value added and contribute to GDP.)

When calculating value added, we add back in industry's added revenue from passthrough expenses (which was removed earlier), because this revenue does contribute to value added (but not to employment or employee compensation).

The EPS only calculates the policy-induced change in *domestic* jobs, GDP, and EE compensation, not *global* jobs, GDP, or EE compensation.  Since each industry's inputs (such as raw steel) are the output of some other industry, the "Buy In-Region Outputs" policy requires domestic industries to get more of their total inputs from domestic suppliers, which we can model by scaling between DLIM and TLIM.  At 100% implementation, an industry utilizes domestic suppliers for its total input needs, so it uses TLIM values to calculate domestic job, GDP, and EE compensation impacts.

These government and household spending variables are only used to determine the proportion of spending going to each ISIC code.  Therefore, the time series projection here is meant simply to reflect how growth or shrinkage of one ISIC code relative to another is reflected in (in reality, partially caused by) changes in government and household spending.  It does not matter whether these variables contain accurate absolute amounts spent, as they are not used for that purpose.

There is no way to use projected output by ISIC code to obtain projected DLIM or TLIM variables.  In general, even if an industry gets larger or smaller in the future, it may need the same sorts of inputs (from its own and from other ISIC codes) to produce a unit of output.  These requirements can shift over time - for instance, an industry that today requires metal might someday require less metal but more plastic.  However, we can't get these sorts of shifts in what inputs industries need and on what they spend their money from changes in total output by that industry, or by other industries.  Therefore, we do not attempt to make time-series DLIM or TLIM variables.

We assume that changes in output for each specific ISIC code are directly proportional to changes in employment, value added, and total employee compensation paid by that ISIC code.  Note that economy-wide shifts in these three metrics (not arising from growth or shrinkage of various ISIC codes, such as a tendency across all industries to pay workers more per hour worked) can be implemented through BPEaCP.

BAU Employment, Value Added, and Employee Compensation by ISIC Code by Year are already time-series values and don't necessarily need modification.  However, they were obtained by scaling these three things by changes in BAU Output.  On the upside, this captures the growth and shrinkage of one industry relative to another, and if an industry with (say) a higher labor intensity becomes bigger, then we will correctly see jobs increase faster than value added.  But it doesn't capture economy-wide effects that shift the balance of these three variables, such as (for example) a trend across all industries to pay workers more money per year per worker.  Therefore, we leave in place the BPEaCP variable, to allow model developers to implement economy-wide shifts in employment, value added, and EE compensation on top of the shifts caused by the growth and shrinkage of specific ISIC codes.

We assume the other IO variables such as BEbIC, BVAbIC, etc. match BObIC in year and data source, so our use of endogenously calculated revenue for fuel suppliers (which introduces differences relative to BObIC) should also be applied to these other input variables, to maintain the labor intensity, value added intensity, and other such relationships between output and the other variables in the source data.

Insofar as each ISIC code's revenues are from non-energy products, we use changes in economic output, since non-energy products are heterogenous and are presently only tracked in financial terms, not as physical quantities of machines, furniture, etc.

In the demand sectors' energy demand feedback loops, we want to feed back in only the percent change in demand caused by the indirect and induced effects of the policy package (as the direct effects are already included in each of these sectors).  The exception is the "Buy In-Region" policy lever, whose direct effects are not included in each sector (as the first place that policy influences the calculation flow is in the I/O model).  Therefore, its direct impacts need to be added to the macroeconomic feedback loops to capture associated energy use and emissions.  (The indirect and induced effects of the Buy In-Region policy are already part of the total indirect and induced effects, so they are already included in the macroeconomic feedback loops.)

We did not reassign any share of the change in industries' output (revenue) to labor (for workforce payments) in front of the IO model.  Therefore, we need to use the full impacts of the change in output on labor cash flow (as calculated by the IO model) to feed into the IO model in the next timestep.  That is, we don't want to limit the change in ouptut used here to indirect effects.

It is okay that direct changes in household cash flow create further changes via this feedback.  For instance, imagine a policy that increases household income (suppose, via a tax cut funded by deficit spending).  Households buy more goods, which leads to more employment and employee compensation, which further increases household cash flow and spending.

In the IO model, indirect impact on value added includes passthrough expenses, because taxes and employee compensation contribute to GDP.  However, a tax that is passed through doesn't increase output, so it should not affect value added when it is used in a feedback loop that adjusts energy service demand.  Therefore, we calculate a special version of indirect impacts on value added here that excludes passthrough costs.

"Change in Domestic Output by ISIC Code" includes the direct, indirect, and induced effects of the policy package on output.  It is used to adjust production levels in the Industry sector.  On the "Cross-Sector Totals" sheet, VAT or sales tax is charged on the total change in output coming from that sector, so the change in VAT or sales tax on all changes in industrial output (not just the direct changes in industrial output) are already being separated from industry revenue and assigned to government ahead of the I/O model.

Carbon taxes are levied upstream on fuel sales, before it is known whether a unit of fuel will be burned with or without CCS.  So the government must pay CCS providers back for the tax they already paid (capitalized into the cost of their fuels).  Also, CCS providers might sell their CCS services on a market for credits.  So carbon tax rebates are distinct rebate payments (which we classify as subsidies), not a reduction in tax.

Taxes on fuel, equipment, and O&M expenses are already included in these totals.  The carbon tax on process emissions needs to be added separately, as it is also part of OpEx.

Any tax revenue that is rebated to households or businesses (i.e. partial or total revenue neutrality) doesn't count toward the Total Change in CapEx and OpEx metric, so we subtract out any tax rebate payments here.

Changes in purchases of non-energy input materials (e.g. raw steel, etc.) are also a part of OpEx, but at present, we don't separate out input materials from other industrial products - we only have the total change in expenditures on all industrial products in variable "Changes in Nonenergy Expenditures by Entity due to Production Changes."  Including this entire variable in the cost metric tends to overwhelm other components of the cost metric when material efficiency policies are enabled.  For now, we exclude changes in spending on input materials from the CapEx + OpEx metric.  We may revisit this in a future EPS update.

Energy-related emissions are all anthropogenic emissions from within the borders of the modeled region except industrial process emissions and anthropogenic LULUCF emissions.  Energy-related emissions captured by CCS do not count as emissions (i.e. we only include net energy-related emissions here).  However, emissions from fuel burned in the geoengineering sector are energy-related emissions, but CO2 captured from the atmosphere (DAC) does not count as negative energy-related emissions.

Whether or not policies are ENABLED, all changes in revenues and expenditures for non-energy industries should be identical to those values when divided by ISIC Code.  Up to about +/- $1 million variance (maybe more with some policy packages) is to be expected due to limitations on accuracy of floating point calculations in Vensim.
