		selected.  Note that we haven't built for the current model year yet in \
		the calculation flow, so the current model year counts as being in the \
		future.  Also note that in order to prevent the policy case line from \
		diverging from the BAU line in years prior to the first year policies take \
		effect (which is often a year in the past), we only give electricity \
		producers foresignt to BAU RPS values in years when the additional RPS \
		policy is not in effect (thus mirroring BAU case foresight).

	~	Plug-in hybrids can shift to either electricity or biofuels.  To model \
		this explicitly would be very difficult, as we'd need to account for three \
		possible shifts (petroleum gasoline to biofuel gasoline, petroleum \
		gasoline to electricity, and biofuel gasoline to electricity).  In \
		practice, biofuel gasoline is hardly used by plug-in hybrids, and \
		electricity will always be the more economical choice for satisfying an \
		LCFS via generation of carbon-free energy.  Therefore, we only allow for \
		one of these three types of shifts in plug-in hybrids: petroleum gasoline \
		to electricity.  Accordingly, we must subtract out the (small) quantity by \
		which biofuels could be increased in plug-in hybrids when calculating the \
		total amount of potential increase in biofuels, to avoid exceeding the \
		maximum allowable shift in gasoline or diesel vehicles (when the shift is \
		assigned to those vehicles, rather than to plug-in hybrids, later in the \
		calculation steps).

		emissions reductions are from gases in proportion to the amount those \
		gases contribute to each industry's total process emissions, excluding \
		CO2.  We separately added a CO2 marginal abatement curve for the cement \
		industry, so we do allow process emissions to come out of CO2 for this \

		its process emissions are effectively non-abatable, and the fraction found \

	~	Plug-in hybrids can shift to either electricity or biofuels.  To model \
		this explicitly would be very difficult, as we'd need to account for three \
		possible shifts (petroleum gasoline to biofuel gasoline, petroleum \
		gasoline to electricity, and biofuel gasoline to electricity).  In \
		practice, biofuel gasoline is hardly used by plug-in hybrids, and \
		electricity will always be the more economical choice for satisfying an \
		LCFS via generation of carbon-free energy.  Therefore, we only allow for \
		one of these three types of shifts in plug-in hybrids: petroleum gasoline \
		to electricity.  Accordingly, we must subtract out the (small) quantity by \
		which biofuels could be increased in plug-in hybrids when calculating the \
		total amount of potential increase in biofuels, to avoid exceeding the \
		maximum allowable shift in gasoline or diesel vehicles (when the shift is \
		assigned to those vehicles, rather than to plug-in hybrids, later in the \
		calculation steps).

		example, natural gas plants built during the model run may be more and \
		more efficient if they are built in later and later years.  The properties \
		of the average natural gas plant built during the model run define the \
		properties of the "newly built" quality level for natural gas plants.  \
		This may be a weighted average of different underlying technologies, like \
		combined cycle, combustion turbine, etc.  This may have the effect of \
		overstating the performance of plants built early in the model run and \
		understating the performance of plants built late in the model run, but it \
		is more feasible from a model standpoint than tracking each annual cohort \
		of power plants individually (with its own set of values for each input \
		variable that defines its properties).

	~	This variable is also known as the "Fuel Economy Rebound Effect" or "Fuel \
		Cost Rebound Effect."  It is the change in VMT as a fraction of the change \
		in fuel cost.  E.g. for a 1% increase in fuel cost per mile, VMT changes \
		by -0.1%.

LDVs Feebate Rate=
	0 {passenger LDVs, except battery electric passenger LDVs}
	~	Dmnl [0,1]
	~	The feebate is set as a fraction of the global best practice feebate rate.  The \
		global best practice feebate rate is $2000 per (hundredth gal/mile), which \
		equates to a $2000 fee on an LDV that gets 20 mpg if the pivot point is 25 \
		mpg.  (To see this: 20 mpg is 0.04 gpm.  25 mpg is 0.05 gpm.  The \
		difference is -.01 gpm.  So in order to levy a $2000 fee on the 20 mpg car \
		when the pivot point is 25 mpg, we need a rate of $2000/.01 gpm.)  The \
		feebate rate is designated in gpm rather than mpg because this provides \
		the same monetary incentive to save a gallon of fuel for all LDVs, despite \
		their different efficiencies.  That is, given a fixed number of miles \
		driven, reducing gpm by 0.01 will save the same quantity of fuel for any \
		car.  Given a fixed number of miles driven, increasing mpg by 0.01 will \
		save different amounts of fuel in different cars, depending on their \
		starting efficiencies.
		
		We're assuming the pivot point is adjusted to always maintain revenue \
		neutrality (no net cost to government or consumers).  This policy lever \
		only applies to passenger LDVs due to a lack of data on feebate effects on \
		other vehicle types.  The policy does not increase the efficiency of \
		battery electric LDVs, as it is assumed that they are already sufficiently \
		fuel-efficient to receive any potential benefits of the feebate, so the \
		feebate would not incentivize further fuel efficiency improvements in this \
		type of LDV.

		information-based travel substitutes, parking supply and pricing policies, \
		roadway/congestion pricing, improving bus transit, and encouraging \
		non-motorized transit such as biking and walking.  For freight, this is \
		primarily mode shifting from truck to rail.

The LCFS calculation (and policy lever setting) refer only to the fuel used by regulated vehicle types (as specified by the model adapter in an input variable), after adjustment for the efficiency of use of electricity.  Hence, we calculate the various LCFS metrics here, as the ratio of carbon free energy to all energy that meets these two conditions.

SoCDTtiNTY values for each vehicle/cargo type combination should typically be found via calibration.  After all other Transportation Sector data are in place, adjust the values of SoCDTtiNTY so as to eliminate abrupt changes in the variable "Retiring Vehicles Summed Across Technologies" at the years corresponding to vehicle lifetimes.

We estimate start year fuel use (that is, one year before the first simulated year) by calculating it using data from the first simulated year.  This saves us the burden of calculating it in Excel and providing it as input data, and it prevents discontinuities as the model switches over from the provided value to a value calculated from the properties of the fleet.

To calibrate a vehicle type with a lifetime longer than the model run, such as rail, temporarily extend the model run by changing FINAL TIME to a farther-out value, such as 2060.  Perform the calibration, then restore FINAL TIME to its former value (2050).

Separately-regulated pollutants are non-CO2 combustion byproducts whose emissions are limited by law, such as a limit on NOx emissions per kilometer.  Improving fuel efficiency causes less fuel to be burned per kilometer, but it may not reduce emissions of NOx per kilometer.  Vehicle manufacturers design vehicles to meet fuel economy and conventional pollutant standards separately and may narrowly comply with each standard.  So, if fuel economy improves, the vehicle manufacturer may allow more NOx to be emitted per gram of gasoline burned, to keep the NOx rate per kilometer just under the standard.  We assume that separately-regulated pollutants are unaffected by changes in fuel economy, while other pollutants increase or decrease in proportion to changes in fuel economy.

A "flexibility point" is a quantity of flexibility on the grid (provided by any combination of dispatchable generation, storage, and demand response) that enables the grid to support BOTH one MW of wind and one MW of solar.  We allow each flexibility point to support both generation types because wind and solar tend to be in need of support/backup at different times of the day and so can use the same flexibility resources.

The RPS ensures enough potential electricity output from RPS-qualifying sources is available.  The RPS does not explicitly affect dispatch, because the contract-based dispatch ought to take priority (and if high enough, is allowed to violate the RPS), and thereafter, the renewables ought to be dispatched first under least cost dispatch anyway, due to their low marginal cost

Policy-mandated new capacity is not subject to the build limits, but any capacity built under this policy does subtract from the amount that can be built apart from this policy (to a minimum of zero).

We assume that quality level has no effect on whether a plant is dispatched under guaranteed dispatch, so each quality level is dispatched in propotion to its commonality.

Since Vensim's ALLOCATE AVAILABLE function can only allocate across elements of a single subscript, we need to move our eleven power plant types and three quality levels into a single 33-element subscript prior to the allocation, then move them back into their respective subscripts after the allocation.

Electricity suppliers approach whichever future-year RPS target produces the highest slope in the current year, so as to minimize the slope of increases in future years.  (This method produces the lowest maximum slope, minimizing the shock to electricity producers.)

If all such slopes are negative (i.e. all future RPS targets are below the surviving RPS-qualifying percentage), the minimum RPS-qualifying percentage sought will drop over time, but this will not matter, as no significant amount of RPS-qualifying resources are likely to retire during the model run.

All support services (demand response, grid batteries, electric vehicles, and transmission capacity across the modeled region border) that can support the grid in one part of the modeled region may not be able to support the grid in a different part of the modeled region, subject to transmission constraints.  Hence, the available peak reduction services from all of these resources are limited by the transmission connectivity coefficient.

This page calculates changes in cash flows due to spending by the electricity sector, including on constructing new generation, buying fuel, OM, building transmission, etc.  It also calculates changes in electricity prices, for use on the "Fuels" sheet.  This sheet does not calculate cash flow impacts of changes in electricity sales, because those are handled on the cash flow pages of the various electricity-demanding sectors.

In this case, electricity suppliers are paying other electricity suppliers, so we don't recognize cash flow changes by entity.  (Broken-out industries are not restricted to the modeled region's borders.)  We do add the Change in Amount Spend on Importing Electricity to the Change in Total Outlays and Change in Capital Labor and Fuel Expenditures metrics, however.

Note that the "heating" building component refers to heating of air.  Water heaters are part of the "appliances" component in this model, as they are unaffected by the building envelope, whereas the "envelope" component influences the energy use of "heating" and "cooling and ventilation" components.

In order to compare the cost of running building components that serve the same buildings with the same fuel, we need to calculate a hypothetical energy use quantity in the BAU case, if the electrification policy (and no other policy) had applied to that case.  Otherwise, we see large increases in cost per unit services for electricity-powered components and large drops for other components, which is wrong, as it would be interpreting a fuel shift as fuel increases and decreases at the same service levels

SoCEUtiNTY values for each component/building type combination should typically be found via calibration.  After all other Buildings Sector data are in place, adjust the values of SoCEUtiNTY so as to eliminate abrupt changes in the variable "Retiring Components Potential Energy Use Summed Across Fuels" at the years corresponding to component lifetimes.

Note that for greater accuracy, it would be necessary to know how many years early components are replaced due to retrofitting, then to subtract out the energy use of the replaced components BOTH from new and from retiring components energy use in that year, because the component isn't being replaced in that year anymore, as it was replaced earlier.  In practice, these subtractions largely cancel each other out, and it's hard to find data on the number of years early that components would be replaced, so we simplify by not including this interaction.

Due to the way we track stock and flow for building components' energy use, the variable "BCEU BAU Components Energy Use" is only used to calculate (1) the start year value and (2) the BAU New Components Energy Use each year.  A separate "BAU Components Energy Use" variable is calculated using stock and flow on the "Buildings - BAU" page.  That version is the true, time-series BAU Components Energy Use (valid for comparison with the policy case Components Energy Use).  Do not compare "BCEU BAU Components Energy Use" with policy scenario outputs.

We calculate the percent reduction in component lifetime due to retrofitting and increase BAU component expenditures by that percentage.  This assumes steady state and should be reasonably accurate for countries without much net growth in floorspace.  It overestimates costs of retrofitting for countries with high rates of net floorspace growth.

We annualize abatement from avoidance of large one-time carbon releases (deforestation, peat fires) over the time required for the forest or peatland to regenerate after a major carbon release.  This avoids unrealistic, spiky results and also allows the associated policies to be treated in a way consistent with other land use sector policies (except improved forest management).

We must separate the fuel used for CCS by sector into two variables (rather than using the CCS Sectors subscript) because they use fuel types that are in different subscripts (Electricity Source and Industrial Fuel), and Vensim won't allow you to use different subscripts in different equations within the same variable.

We must include a one-step delay before calculating costs and fuel use to power CCS, as electricity is one of the fuels that can power CCS (in the Industry sector), and this influences electricity demand, which influences "Electricity Sector Pollutant Emissions before CCS," used here as a cap on possible sequestration from electric sector generation types.  (Note that Vensim incorrectly fails to generate a "Simultaneous Equation" error in the Policy (non-BAU) version of this loop, but it is actually circular in both the BAU and non-BAU structures.)

This variable includes CCS effects on industry (that is, sequestered CO2 and emissions from the fuel burned to power the sequestration process) even though some sequestered CO2 might be process CO2 (e.g. in the cement sector).  We don't want to exclude industrial CCS from this variable completely, and we don't currently have a breakdown of how much CO2 sequestered was process CO2 vs. energy-related CO2.
