		lumped CO2e, not broken out by gas.  Accordingly, we assume process \
		emissions reductions are from gases in proportion to the amount those \
		gases contribute to each industry's total process emissions, excluding \
		CO2.  We separately added a CO2 marginal abatement curve for the cement \
		industry, so we do allow process emissions to come out of CO2 for this \
		specific industry.  (Iron and steel is excluded from the EPA source, so \
		its process emissions are effectively non-abatable, and the fraction found \
		in this variable does not matter for that industry.)

		practice, biofuel gasoline is hardly used by plug-in hybrids, and \
		electricity will always be the more economical choice for satisfying an \
		LCFS via generation of carbon-free energy.  Therefore, we only allow for \
		one of these three types of shifts in plug-in hybrids: petroleum gasoline \
		to electricity.  Accordingly, we must subtract out the (small) quantity by \
		which biofuels could be increased in plug-in hybrids when calculating the \
		total amount of potential increase in biofuels, to avoid exceeding the \
		maximum allowable shift in gasoline or diesel vehicles (when the shift is \
		assigned to those vehicles, rather than to plug-in hybrids, later in the \

		would indicate that the given plant type produces electricity at its \

		unattainable because of necessary maintenance and repairs (for all plant \

	~	For vehicle types that can use electricity, this variable specifies the \
		percentage reduction in fuel use (on a BTU basis) relative to the typical \
		fuel type for that vehicle type (e.g. gasoline for LDVs, diesel for HDVs, \
		etc.) due to the fact that electricity can be converted into work more \

Power Plant Quality:

	~	Each of these three quality levels is the average plant of its type.  For \
		example, natural gas plants built during the model run may be more and \
		more efficient if they are built in later and later years.  The properties \
		of the average natural gas plant built during the model run define the \
		properties of the "newly built" quality level for natural gas plants.  \
		This may be a weighted average of different underlying technologies, like \
		combined cycle, combustion turbine, etc.  This may have the effect of \
		overstating the performance of plants built early in the model run and \
		understating the performance of plants built late in the model run, but it \
		is more feasible from a model standpoint than tracking each annual cohort \
		of power plants individually (with its own set of values for each input \
		variable that defines its properties).

		an unrealistic way.  The curve with an initial value of zero is much \
		closer to the original (unsmoothed) curve than SMOOTH with no initial \

		negative if a foreign firm has a lower carbon intensity than a U.S. firm \
		when producing a particular good (this is the case for natural gas and \

LDVs Feebate Rate=
	0 {passenger LDVs, except battery electric passenger LDVs}
	~	Dmnl [0,1]
	~	The feebate is set as a fraction of the global best practice feebate rate.  The \
		global best practice feebate rate is $2000 per (hundredth gal/mile), which \
		equates to a $2000 fee on an LDV that gets 20 mpg if the pivot point is 25 \
		mpg.  (To see this: 20 mpg is 0.04 gpm.  25 mpg is 0.05 gpm.  The \
		difference is -.01 gpm.  So in order to levy a $2000 fee on the 20 mpg car \
		when the pivot point is 25 mpg, we need a rate of $2000/.01 gpm.)  The \
		feebate rate is designated in gpm rather than mpg because this provides \
		the same monetary incentive to save a gallon of fuel for all LDVs, despite \
		their different efficiencies.  That is, given a fixed number of miles \
		driven, reducing gpm by 0.01 will save the same quantity of fuel for any \
		car.  Given a fixed number of miles driven, increasing mpg by 0.01 will \
		save different amounts of fuel in different cars, depending on their \
		starting efficiencies.
		
		We're assuming the pivot point is adjusted to always maintain revenue \
		neutrality (no net cost to government or consumers).  This policy lever \
		only applies to passenger LDVs due to a lack of data on feebate effects on \
		other vehicle types.  The policy does not increase the efficiency of \
		battery electric LDVs, as it is assumed that they are already sufficiently \
		fuel-efficient to receive any potential benefits of the feebate, so the \
		feebate would not incentivize further fuel efficiency improvements in this \
		type of LDV.

		improved labeling.  The labeling influences consumers who are buying \
		appliances of all Quality levels, so it's represented as a simple \
		percentage increase in the efficiency of components sold (at all quality \
		levels).  (If Quality Levels are defined based on particular efficiency \
		thresholds, this may mean the number of square feet served by components \
		of a given quality level will not be accurate, but the end result in terms \
		of energy use will still be accurate.  It's just a question of the meaning \
		of the labels we give to each Quality level.)

This variable is subscripted by fuel because the reference point (carbon intensity that neither generates nor requires credits) varies between gasoline and diesel, and each of the low-carbon fuels tends to replace either gasoline or diesel.  This variable does NOT give the quantity of each low-carbon fuel needed to generate one credit.

The price of an amount of low-carbon fuel needed to generate one LCFS credit buys two things: the credit itself, plus the fuel (to do useful work).  The value of each low-carbon fuel is estimated via the value of the energy-equivalent amount of its corresponding reference fuel, as they can perform the same work.  Accordingly, the LCFS credit value is based on the increment between the costs of the low-carbon fuel and the energy equivalent amount of its reference fuel.  (Note that this involves a simplification, as the ease of using the underlying fuel in vehicles is not taken into account.  For example, it is easier to use diesel than an energy equivalent amount of natural gas due to the fact that most existing HDVs are designed to use diesel.)

The LCFS calculation (and policy lever setting) refer only to the fuel used by regulated vehicle types (as specified by the model adapter in an input variable), after adjustment for the efficiency of use of electricity.  Hence, we calculate the various LCFS metrics here, as the ratio of carbon free energy to all energy that meets these two conditions.

Carbon Free Energy (CFE) refers to the decarbonized portion of the energy from natural gas and biofuels (relative to the reference fuels gasoline or diesel) and all electricity used as a transport fuel (irrespective of how the electricity was produced).

SoCDTtiNTY values for each vehicle/cargo type combination should typically be found via calibration.  After all other Transportation Sector data are in place, adjust the values of SoCDTtiNTY so as to eliminate abrupt changes in the variable "Retiring Vehicles Summed Across Technologies" at the years corresponding to vehicle lifetimes.

We estimate start year fuel use (that is, one year before the first simulated year) by calculating it using data from the first simulated year.  This saves us the burden of calculating it in Excel and providing it as input data, and it prevents discontinuities as the model switches over from the provided value to a value calculated from the properties of the fleet.

To calibrate a vehicle type with a lifetime longer than the model run, such as rail, temporarily extend the model run by changing FINAL TIME to a farther-out value, such as 2060.  Perform the calibration, then restore FINAL TIME to its former value (2050).

A "flexibility point" is a quantity of flexibility on the grid (provided by any combination of dispatchable generation, storage, and demand response) that enables the grid to support BOTH one MW of wind and one MW of solar.  We allow each flexibility point to support both generation types because wind and solar tend to be in need of support/backup at different times of the day and so can use the same flexibility resources.

The RPS ensures enough potential electricity output from RPS-qualifying sources is available.  The RPS does not explicitly affect dispatch, because the contract-based dispatch ought to take priority (and if high enough, is allowed to violate the RPS), and thereafter, the renewables ought to be dispatched first under least cost dispatch anyway, due to their low marginal cost

Policy-mandated new capacity is not subject to the build limits, but any capacity built under this policy does subtract from the amount that can be built apart from this policy (to a minimum of zero).

We assume that quality level has no effect on whether a plant is dispatched under guaranteed dispatch, so each quality level is dispatched in propotion to its commonality.

Since Vensim's ALLOCATE AVAILABLE function can only allocate across elements of a single subscript, we need to move our eleven power plant types and three quality levels into a single 33-element subscript prior to the allocation, then move them back into their respective subscripts after the allocation.

Electricity suppliers approach whichever future-year RPS target produces the highest slope in the current year, so as to minimize the slope of increases in future years.  (This method produces the lowest maximum slope, minimizing the shock to electricity producers.)

If all such slopes are negative (i.e. all future RPS targets are below the surviving RPS-qualifying percentage), the minimum RPS-qualifying percentage sought will drop over time, but this will not matter, as no significant amount of RPS-qualifying resources are likely to retire during the model run.

All support services (demand response, grid batteries, and electric vehicles) that can support the grid in one part of the modeled region may not be able to support the grid in a different part of the modeled region, subject to transmission constraints.  Hence, the available peak reduction services from all of these resources are limited by the transmission connectivity coefficient.

This page calculates changes in cash flows due to spending by the electricity sector, including on constructing new generation, buying fuel, OM, building transmission, etc.  It also calculates changes in electricity prices, for use on the "Fuels" sheet.  This sheet does not calculate cash flow impacts of changes in electricity sales, because those are handled on the cash flow pages of the various electricity-demanding sectors.

In this case, electricity suppliers are paying other electricity suppliers, so we don't recognize cash flow changes by entity.  (Broken-out industries are not restricted to the modeled region's borders.)  We do add the Change in Amount Spend on Importing Electricity to the Change in Total Outlays and Change in Capital Labor and Fuel Expenditures metrics, however.

Note that the "heating" building component refers to heating of air.  Water heaters are part of the "appliances" component in this model, as they are unaffected by the building envelope, whereas the "envelope" component influences the energy use of "heating" and "cooling and ventilation" components.

In order to compare the cost of running building components that serve the same buildings with the same fuel, we need to calculate a hypothetical energy use quantity in the BAU case, if the electrification policy (and no other policy) had applied to that case.  Otherwise, we see large increases in cost per unit services for electricity-powered components and large drops for other components, which is wrong, as it would be interpreting a fuel shift as fuel increases and decreases at the same service levels

SoCEUtiNTY values for each component/building type combination should typically be found via calibration.  After all other Buildings Sector data are in place, adjust the values of SoCEUtiNTY so as to eliminate abrupt changes in the variable "Retiring Components Potential Energy Use Summed Across Fuels" at the years corresponding to component lifetimes.

We calculate the percent reduction in component lifetime due to retrofitting and increase BAU component expenditures by that percentage.  This assumes steady state and should be reasonably accurate for countries without much net growth in floorspace.  It overestimates costs of retrofitting for countries with high rates of net floorspace growth.

We annualize abatement from avoidance of large one-time carbon releases (deforestation, peat fires) over the time required for the forest or peatland to regenerate after a major carbon release.  This avoids unrealistic, spiky results and also allows the associated policies to be treated in a way consistent with other land use sector policies (except improved forest management).

We must separate the fuel used for CCS by sector into two variables (rather than using the CCS Sectors subscript) because they use fuel types that are in different subscripts (Electricity Source and Industrial Fuel), and Vensim won't allow you to use different subscripts in different equations within the same variable.

We do not retire any CCS equipment during the model run, because CCS equipment is relatively new and is long-lived (25-40 years).  We include this CCS equipment lifetime input variable in case we want to extend the length of the model run in the future and retiring CCS becomes relevant.

We must include a one-step delay before calculating costs and fuel use to power CCS, as electricity is one of the fuels that can power CCS (in the Industry sector), and this influences electricity demand, which influences "Electricity Sector Pollutant Emissions before CCS," used here as a cap on possible sequestration from electric sector generation types.  (Note that Vensim incorrectly fails to generate a "Simultaneous Equation" error in the Policy (non-BAU) version of this loop, but it is actually circular in both the BAU and non-BAU structures.)

We estimate the effect of user-set policies collectively on the economy-wide emissions intensity here.  We use regular rather than "after GDP Adjustment" total to avoid the need for a SIMULTANEOUS directive, which works here but is fragile to changes in input data and model structure.  It makes little difference to the numerical results.

We generally don't use the "after GDP adjustment" versions of emissions variables, because the GDP adjustment only accounts for changes in energy prices, not the whole range of impacts the policies might have on GDP.  We mostly include this structure in case of future model extensions that may refine the Change in GDP calculation, making the "after GDP Adjustment" variables more meaningful.
