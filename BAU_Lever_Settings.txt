# BAU_Lever_Settings.txt
#
# This file specifies path and cell references to the BAU settings for levers
# that may be set to non-zero values in the BAU case.  This generally only
# applies to control levers (levers that affect both BAU and Policy cases),
# as policy levers typically are zero in the BAU case (and typically
# don't have any associated CSV files from which they read values).
#
# The format is:
#   Vensim lever variable name (including any subscript values)
#   Path to CSV file containing this lever's BAU value
#   Reference to cell containing this lever's BAU value
#
# The web app checks these cells to set the up the BAU case in the web app.
# This file is only used by the web app, not by Vensim.
#
# This file can contain references to control levers that are not exposed
# in the web interface.  The web app should simply ignore any settings here
# that do not correspond to a control lever displayed in the web app.
# (That lever might be displayed in a different EPS geography.)
#
# This file should only change when the number or subscripting of control
# levers changes (i.e., in certain numbered EPS releases).  It should not be
# edited for different EPS geographies that use the same EPS version number.
