### **3.1.2 - Feb. 18, 2021**

* New Features
  * Split ISIC 05T06 into coal mining (ISIC 05) and oil and gas extraction (ISIC 06)
* Data Updates
  * Updated emissions intensities for non-GHGs to align with EPA's National Emissions Inventory
  * Updated HFC data with values supplied by the U.S. Climate Alliance
  * BAU electricity subsidies updated for recent PTC and ITC extensions
  * Updated potential for industrial electrification, based on temperature ranges of industrial heat demand
  * Updated electric vehicle prices
  * Updated CCS costs
  * Other minor data input updates
* Bug Fixes
  * Fixed minor formula error in peak demand calculations
  * Fixed error that affected the recipient fuel fractions for the Industrial Electrification and Hydrogen policy lever
  * Use fuel supplier revenue totals by fuel directly in the input-ouput model instead of calculating multipliers to divide up revenue for certain fuel-supplying cash flow entities 

### **3.1.1 - Dec. 18, 2020**

* Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) policy is now split into two policy levers: Electricity sector CCS and Industry sector CCS.  Electricity sector CCS is subscripted by plant type, while Industry sector CCS is subscripted by industry and by emissions type (energy-related or process emissions).
* New policy: Toggle to non-BAU capacity retirement schedule (in electricity sector)
* Updated 1.5 °C Scenario to take advantage of the new capabilities of the CCS policy levers
* Updated BAU global battery storage capacity input data to latest version

### **3.1.0.1 - Dec. 9, 2020**

* Edited 1.5 °C Scenario

### **3.1.0 - Dec. 9, 2020**

* New Features
  * Policy implementation schedules may now be set separately for every subscripted element of every policy lever.  For example, this allows different start dates for energy efficiency standards applied to the steel industry vs. the cement industry.  (Each industry is an element of the "industrial energy efficiency standards" policy lever.)
  * Improved procedure for allocating responsibility for emissions abatement amongst policies within a policy package, used in calculating wedge thicknesses in the wedge diagram and box widths in the cost curve.  A description of the improved procedure [can be found here](https://github.com/Energy-Innovation/eps-us/issues/119).
  * Replaced "Net Zero" scenario with "1.5°C Pathway" scenario
  * Edits to indst/BPEiC and indst/PERAC streamline IEA data integration and internationalization
  * Industry energy efficiency standards are now subscripted by fuel type (and continue to be subscripted by industry)
  * Updated Net Zero reference scenario
  * New input variable bldgs/SoBRCBbG allows a user to specify a share of building retrofitting costs incurred due to the retrofitting policy that will be funded by the government
  * The EPS can be configured to vary the prices of more types of fuels based on changes in fuel supplier expenditures than were previously supported
  * The Transportation Demand Management (TDM) lever has been overhauled and renamed Mode Shifting.  It now uses a new data approach that is easier to internationalize and is subscripted by vehicle type as well as cargo type, allowing finer control in policy scenarios.
  * Added output graph of sources of change in government cash flow
  * New control lever allows exclusion of emissions from generating exported electricity
  * In EPS regional models that use hard-coded renewable energy capacity construction costs (i.e., those that disabled endogenous learning), soft costs now reduce the effect of the capital cost R&D lever and can be reduced using the soft cost reduction policy lever
  * Time-series power plant fixed and variable O&M input data may now be used (elec/CCaMC)
* Various input data updates, including updated power plant properties and COVID-19 recession impacts
* Bug Fixes
  * Fixed rounding error in hydrogen capital equipment costs
  * The construction industry's ISIC code is no longer part of the "other industries" category ISIC codes, correcting some minor issues where too many cash flows were assigned to the construction industry
  * Certain cash flows to ISIC codes within the "other industries" category are now allocated based on utility or energy spending rather than output
  * Increased precision with which transmission line construction costs are assigned to ISIC codes
  * Greatly increased precision with which cash flow changes for fuel-supplying entities are assigned to ISIC codes
  * The effect of passthrough costs on industrial production will no longer cause minor oscillation in certain EPS deployments

### **3.0.0 - Oct 19, 2020**

* New Input-Output Model
  * An economic input/output (I/O) model has been added as a component of the Energy Policy Simulator.
  * New output metrics include the change in gross domestic product (GDP), employment (jobs), total employee compensation, average compensation per employee, number of union and non-union jobs, government spending, budget deficit/surplus, household tax revenue, payroll tax revenue, corporate income tax revenue, size of the national debt, and interest paid on the national debt.
  * Changes in GDP, jobs, and compensation can also be visualized disaggregated by economic sector or by their direct, indirect, and induced components.
  * Respending of changes in cash flow for government, households, and industries is now accounted for, providing a holistic look at policy impacts on economic activity.
  * New Government Revenue Accounting (GRA) settings allows the user to specify how government raises or spends changes in revenue caused by the policy package.  Options include changes in regular spending, deficit spending, household taxes, payroll taxes, and corporate income taxes.
  * Feedback loops from the I/O model to the Transportation, Buildings, and Industry sectors capture the energy demand and emissions associated with indirect and induced economic activity.
  * A new [documentation page](io-model.html) explains the I/O model in detail.
  * We gratefully acknowledge the invaluable contributions of the [American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy](https://www.aceee.org/) (ACEEE), [Jim Barrett](https://www.barretteconomics.com/), and [Skip Laitner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/skip-laitner-746b124/) for their guidance and advice in implementing this feature, and for allowing us to learn from the [DEEPER I/O model](https://www.aceee.org/files/pdf/fact-sheet/DEEPER_Methodology.pdf), originally created by Skip Laitner.
* Improved Public Health Calculations
  * In addition to the policy package's effects on premature mortality (introduced in version 1.0.3), the EPS now calculates impacts on 10 additional health outcomes, including lost workdays, hospital admissions, non-fatal heart attacks, asthma attacks, respiratory symptoms and bronchitis.
* Data Updates
  * First simulated year advanced from 2018 to 2019
  * Data in input variables based on EIA Annual Energy Outlook updated to use AEO 2020 values
  * Various other input data updates 
* Other Improvements
  * Industry Sector
    * Industrial process emissions multipliers (used in indst/BPEiC and indst/PERAC) are now disaggregated by gas.  These multipliers now allow for replacement of BPEiC data with arbitary, user-specified data while keeping abatement potentials and costs in PERAC in sync with BPEiC.
    * Added revenue data for "water & waste" industry (water treatment, wastewater, solid waste collection, landfilling, recycling, etc.)
    * Use of the material efficiency policy on the chemicals industry and on the other industries category is now disallowed because these industry categories are aggregates in our new I/O data (chemicals includes pharmaceuticals), and the material efficiency cannot target only the relevant parts of these aggregates to obtain accurate financial outcomes
    * Industry now can pass on a share of its policy-driven changes in expenditures to buyers of its products (specified in indst/SoCiIEPTtB).  Removed embedded carbon and associated cost calculations for vehicles, power plants, and building components, to avoid double-counting.  (The new approach covers all products in the economy and all sources of expenditure changes, not just a carbon tax.)
    * The model now accounts for more different types of costs that are passed through to buyers when calculating the policy-driven change in industrial production, such as the costs of capital equipment purchased in response to energy efficiency standards and the costs of implementing process emissions abatement policies.
  * Electricity Sector
    * Peak power demand calculations now calculate summer and winter peaks separately
    * Peak power demand calculations use equipment load factors (elec/ELF) to more accurately determine peak demand, which is particularly important in scenarios with substantial electrification
    * Users may now override endogenous learning for electricity generation capacity by specifying time series capital costs in elec/CCaMC
    * Imported electricity price and BAU exported electricity price may now be customized
    * Balance of system is now included in grid battery costs (and is unaffected by endogenous learning)
    * Soft costs for onshore wind, offshore wind, and solar PV power plants (and distributed solar PV) now accept time-series BAU data
    * Power plant fuel type shifting (such as coal-to-gas retrofits) will now only occur if the target power plant type is economic (not subject to economically-driven early retirement) or if the target fuel is a drop-in replacement (i.e. no retrofitting required).
    * Grid battery policy is now set as a fraction of potential capacity achieved rather than as a percentage growth rate, allowing for finer control over timing and quantity of grid battery deployment
  * Fuels
    * Added output graphs of Embedded CO2 in Exported Fuels and Change in Embedded CO2 in Exported Fuels
    * The carbon tax rate may now be explicitly set for District Heat and Hydrogen sector instead of inheriting the Industry sector rate
    * Fuels cost input data and Vensim sheet reorganized for clarity and ease of adaptation to other regions
    * Change in carbon tax revenue and change in fuel tax revenue are now calculated explicitly, to support new government revenue handling options
    * Reduced domestic demand for domestically-produced fuels is now partially compensated for by increased exports (fuels/PoFDCtAE)
  * Buildings Sector
    * Implemented cash flows for efficient building component rebate policy
    * Building fuel shifting policy now accounts for incremental capital costs of electrified (i.e. heat pump) building heating systems and water heaters
  * Other
    * WebAppData now detects duplicate and missing policy ID numbers
    * The model no longer uses GET DIRECT DATA to access data from outside of the model run timeframe
    * Model structure diagram updated to show new economic and public health outputs
    * Fraction of technology outside modeled region that affects endogenous learning can now be customized (endo-learn/FoTOMRAEL)
    * All Python scripts now include the capability to limit the time range of data written to output files
    * Policy package CapEx + OpEx and Cost Curve output graphs now respond to user's government revenue handling selections to determine revenue neutrality
* Bug Fixes
  * Fixed off-by-one-year error in cement process CO2 multipliers (indst/BPEiC) and two missing formulas for cement (indst/PERAC)
  * Do not exclude heat as a fuel type that can power industry CCS
  * Added geoengineering sector to energy-related CO2 output graphs
  * Limited effect of building component labeling policy to affected market share (bldgs/PPEIdtIL)
  * Fixed formula error in "Change in Amount Spent on Vehicle Maintenance"
  * Fixed double-counting of certain cash flow changes due to changes in industrial production
  * Very high carbon tax rates applied to industrial process (non-energy) emissions can no longer cause oscillating production changes
  * Fixed bug in "Subsidy Paid on Distributed Solar Capacity" formula
  * Capital costs for new CCS equipment are now allocated amongst power plant types and amongst industries proportionally to year-over-year increase in CCS usage instead of total current-year CCS usage by each plant type and industry
  * Power plant decommissioning costs are no longer charged if a power plant type has retired to zero and there is no capacity left to retire
  * The industrial fuel shifting policy's capital equipment costs now account for increases in usage of all industrial fuel types

### **2.1.2 - July 9, 2020**

* Fixed minor formula error in variable "Potential RPS Qualifying Electricity Output" and its BAU equivalent

### **2.1.1-us-v2 - May 12, 2020**

* Updated COVID-19 recession's GDP impact and elasticities of sectoral-energy-use-to-GDP using latest data from EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook (ctrl-settings/GDPGR, ctrl-settings/EoSEUwGDPiR, plcy-schd/FoPITY)

### **2.1.1 - May 12, 2020**

* Major Improvements
  * Added capability to simulate COVID-19 recession impacts, adjustable in the web interface via a policy-like slider and implementation schedule.  This simulates effects of exogenous GDP changes on demand for energy, energy-using services, and products.  It can be adapted for different countries or reconfigured to represent other economic recessions (or booms) via updated input data.
  * The CCS policy lever has been overhauled.  It now is set in terms of a percentage of CO<sub>2</sub> captured, is subscripted by sector (electricity and industry sectors), and can be used to capture industrial process CO<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> from fuel burned to power the CCS process itself.
* Minor Improvements
  * Added graphs of industry sector energy-related CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions by industry and by pollutant to web interface
  * Vehicle maintenance costs are now included and are considered in vehicle technology selection
  * When new peaker plants are built to meet peak electricity demand, cost-based allocation is used instead of allocating proportinally to existing peaker capacity
  * Output graph definitions in WebAppData now have an include/exclude flag, and localizing units is easier thanks to a new unit selection tab
  * Added three *X*-per-unit-BAU-GDP output graphs to WebAppData (unflagged for U.S.) to support regions where this metric is commonly used, such as India
  * Non-country multipliers for industrial process emissions (indst/BPEiC and indst/PERAC) now accept time series values
  * Updated input data in elec/ARpUIiRC, elec/BCRbQ, elec/BECF, elec/BRPSPTY, elec/DRC, elec/DRCo, elec/CCaMC, elec/MCGLT, fuels/BCFpUEbS, and trans/BVTStL
  * The relationship between increases in transmission capacity and the usable fraction of flexibility points is now governed by an input variable (elec/EoTCCwTC) rather than a hard-coded relationship, giving the EPS the flexibility to better represent renewables deployment and curtailment in power systems facing varying degrees of transmission constraints
  * In the District Heat sector, heat pumps can be represented using the electricity fuel type.  dist-heat/EoCtUH now includes heat pump efficiency data.
  * Metallurgical (feedstock) coal is now included in industrial coal use (indst/BIFUbC and indst/BPoIFUfE)
* Bug Fixes
  * Added missing non-country multiplier for cement process emissions (in indst/BPEiC and indst/PERAC)
  * Nuclear lifetime extension policy is no longer shown in U.S. web app because BAU data already incorporate extensions (to 80-year operating lifetimes) except where a plant is known to be closing sooner
  * Labor now correctly receives a share of revenues from building retrofitting and from distributed solar deployment
  * Fixed overly-high costs for utility demand response (DR) programs caused by outliers in input dataset

### **2.0.0 - Oct 7, 2019**

* New Hydrogen Supply Sector
  * There now exists a new sector in the EPS that calculates hydrogen production (in response to hydrogen demand from other sectors) and associated energy use, emissions, costs/savings, electricity demand response potential, etc.

  * Retail prices of district heat and hydrogen are now by default influenced by changes in costs for district heat producers and hydrogen producers, with control lever plcy-ctrl-ctr/BAEPAbCiPC governing default behavior.  A subscripted policy lever toggles this behavior in the policy case.
* Transportation Sector
  * Two new vehicle technologies have been added: LPG vehicle and hydrogen vehicle
  * New Policy: Reduce EV Range Anxiety and Charging Time (with support variable trans/BRAaCTSC)

  * Fixed omission of changes in the cost of biomass burned in buildings from the total change in biomass and biofuel supplier cash flow
  * Fixed bug where building component electrification could be mistaken for efficiency changes when calculating changes in cost of new building components
* Financial Calculations and Outputs
  * The Cash Flow Entity subscript has been redesigned.  It now contains the following nine entities: government, nonenergy industries, labor and consumers, foreign entities, electricity suppliers, coal suppliers, natural gas and petroleum suppliers, biomass and biofuel suppliers, other energy suppliers.  This helps with tracking cash flow allocations more uniformly and allows handling of imports and exports to/from the modeled region.
  * Cash flow allocations have been redesigned for improved accuracy, clarity, and code uniformity across sectors and cash flow entities
  * Changes in cash flow for each of the nine cash flow entities are now disaggregated into changes in domestic revenue, changes in export revenue, changes in energy expenditures, and changes in non-energy expenditures

  * Removed the "Total Outlays" cost metric (and its revenue-neutral version), as they are now superfluous
  * Improved accuracy of calculation of change in thermal fuel subsidies paid, particularly in scenarios with high carbon prices
* CCS
  * CCS capital equipment and OM costs are now allocated to electricity sources within the electricity sector and to industries within the industry sector
* District Heat

### **1.4.3-us-v2 - May 31, 2019**

* Updated US input data to latest year sources (including EIA AEO 2019 and EPA Greenhouse Gas Inventory 2019)
* Industry Sector
  * Applied a scaling factor to methane process emissions from natural gas and petroleum systems to account for a [recent study](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6398/186) showing that the EPA Greenhouse Gas Inventory underreports methane leaks
  * Corrected a minor formula error in natural gas methane emissions
* Buildings Sector
  * Corrected formula in bldgs/DSCF to average the low and mid technology progress cases, while omitting the constant technology case.
  * Smoothed the first 3 years of bldgs/BCEU data for certain components to avoid sharp discontinuities in Retiring Components Potential Energy use during the model run
  * Fixed minor error in bldgs/BCEU district heat projections
* Transportation Sector
  * BEV and PHEV vehicle prices were updated in trans/BNVP to reflect weighted averages of all relevant AEO vehicle types (e.g., 100-, 200-, and 300- mile range BEVs). The BEV calculation includes an additional $4,000 to represent the perceived range anxiety cost. The BAU EV subsidy percent (trans/BESP) was also updated to reflect updated vehicle prices.
  * Corrected minor error in trans/BS for jet fuel
  * Updated lifetime of buses in trans/AVL
  * Updated price of battery passenger HDVs to use the current electric bus price, scaled to show the same price decrease as passenger LDVs
  * The share of new passenger LDVs and HDVs that can be electric was changed to reach 100% by 2050 in trans/MPNVbT
  * The maximum biofuel blending allowed in aviation, ships, and rail, found in trans/MPoEFUbVT, was changed from 0% to now reach 20% by 2040
* Electricity Sector
  * Changed the Renewable Portfolio Standard policy to a Clean Energy Standard, to better reflect national conversations around electricity sector decarbonization. Qualifying resource definitions were updated in elec/RQSD and elec/BRQSD, and the BAU standard in elec/BRPSPTY was updated to reflect state RPS/CES targets and BAU hydro and nuclear capacity.
  * Updated elec/MCGLT to allow more renewable energy additions each year. A multiplier was applied to the existing offshore wind values, and solar PV was adjusted to allow for the same annual additions as wind, once significant solar deployment is achieved. Also included a minor update to value for natural gas.
  * Changed the petroleum value for elec/NSDoDC to be the same as natural gas peaker plants. The previous standard deviation in petroleum plant dispatch costs was so wide that the model over-dispatched petroleum relative to other projections.
  * Updated Norm St Dev of New Capital Costs for solar in elec/NSDoNCC to reflect recent data from Berkeley Lab
  * Changed reference source for onshore and offshore wind peak time capacity factors in elec/PTCF
  * Changed offshore wind methodology in elec/CCaMC to use weighted average of the low annual technology baseline (ATB) overnight capital costs
  * To avoid nuclear curtailment, which is not representative of real-world systems, elec/BDSBaPCF and elec/BGDPbES were changed to allow nuclear to bid at peak capacity factor and have 100% guaranteed dispatch, respectively.
* Other Model Components
  * Updated natural gas and coal prices in fuels/BFCpUEbS to use AEO short-term forecasts, which are then scaled by trends in the AEO reference case. This change more accurately reflects near-term fossil fuel prices.

  * Changed name of "Induced Foreign GHG Emissions" to "Induced Foreign Emissions" because we no longer limit this to GHGs
  * Changed industry fuel use calculation flow to avoid introducing noise from rounding error
  * Fixed bug where carbon tax effect on capital cost of new power plants due to embedded carbon content was not reflected in cash flow calculations
  * CO2 captured by CCS for each industrial sector and electricity source is now capped at the total amount of CO2 generated by that industrial sector or electricity source
  * Cost reductions for CCS technology achieved through endogenous learning are no longer lost if CCS sequestration rate declines in a later year of the model run

### **1.1.4 - July 25, 2016**

* New policy: Fraction of Natural Gas Use Converted to Other Fuels (Industry Sector).  Updated Python scripts with new policy.
* New input data variable: PIFURfE Percentage Industry Fuel Use Reduction for Electricity
* RIFF Recipient Industrial Fuel Fractions is now a category and contains separate input data files for the recipient fuel types when switching from coal and the recipient fuel types when switching from natural gas
* RM Reserve Margin is now a time-series input data variable to support countries with projected future reserve margins that vary by year
* Added "Fuel Price Multiplier for Sensitivity Analysis Runs" to facilitate introducing variance in fuel prices during Monte Carlo simulations
* Improved input data for (Buildings Sector) Elasticity of Component Price with Respect to Energy Use
* Fixed bug where subsidy for distributed solar capacity only was only paid for distributed solar capacity caused by the subsidy instead of all new distributed solar capacity

### **1.1.3 - June 28, 2016**

* Fixed swapped U.S. web app guidance text between Methane Capture and Methane Destruction policies
* Added limit to ensure process emissions reductions for a given industry and pollutant cannot exceed total process emissions of that pollutant from that industry
* Updated guidance text on R&D policies in web app to reflect change in model start year (from a previous model update)
* Updated CCS lever guidance text to reflect change in data source (from a previous model update)

### **1.1.2 - May 12, 2016**

* Increase in Distributed PV in the BAU case is no longer allowed to be negative for purposes of calculating the effects of a subsidy on distributed solar deployment
* Fixed bug where costs of commercial building components purchased due to the accelerated retrofitting policy were omitted
* The Industry Sector emissions graph in Vensim is now CO2e (not CO2), to better illustrate the effects of process emissions policies, and is labeled "Industry and Agriculture CO2e Emissions" for clarity
* In the Electricity Sector, the capacity that may be retired early in a single year for policy-driven economic reasons is now capped at the amount of capacity that may be built of plant types not subject to cost-based early retirement in that year
* Reduced expenditures by government on subsidies for thermal fuels due to the Reduction of BAU Subsidies policy are now properly counted
* Fixed a few typos in Python scripts
* Fixed two incorrectly alphabetized entries and one omission in acronym-key.xlsx
* Updated Pollutant Emissions Intensities to GREET 2015 (from GREET 2014).
* Adjusted GREET pollutant emissions intensities to be based on higher heating values (gross energy content) of fuels, to match the format of the energy use data from EIA.  Adjustment can be toggled on/off to assist in internationalization.
* Updated to a more recent source for solar PV in MCGLT Max Capacity Growth Lookup Table

### **1.1.1 - Apr 2, 2016**

* "Fuel Weighted Percent Change in Production due to Policies" no longer gives an error when a country's input dataset doesn't assign any fuel usage to one of the model's Industry categories
* Added "MPCFR Maximum Possible Capacity Factor Reduction" to more realistically model rare situations in which peaker plants that are providing necessary flexibility points retire, leaving the model in extreme FP deficit
* Graph definition file no longer specifies Y-axis maximum on Vensim CO2e graph (to aid in internationalization)
* "Fraction of Buildable Capacity Actually Built" and its BAU equivalent now report "1" when no capacity is buildable, rather than a divide-by-zero error
* Which plant types are treated as peakers is now specified in a new input variable, "Boolean Is This Plant Type a Peaker" (for instance, because different countries may use petroleum as a peaking or non-peaking resource).  Affects behavior in peaking construction, in dispatch, and in flexibility point calculations.
* Changed name of variable "Fraction of Peakers that are Combustion Turbines" to "Fraction of Peakers that Provide Flexibility Points"
* Changed name of variable "Flexibility Points Provided Per Unit NG Peaker Capacity" to remove the term "NG"
* Added "BAU" to name of variable "FPC BAU Transmission Connectivity Coefficient."  A non-BAU version is calculated in the policy case.
* Added "BRPSPTY BAU RPS Percentage This Year" to acronym key.
* "Percentage of RPS Qualifying Potential Output to Seek This Year" is now set to zero if the slopes to all future RPS values are negative (i.e. if we have more RPS resources than we will need in any future year of the model run).
* Changed default implementation schedule for Avoid Deforestation policy to phase in linearly
* Added "FPC Target Maximum Fraction of Flexibility Points Used" and a few calculated variables to avoid building flexibility-using resources beyond a given flexibility point threshold (by default, 140% FP usage), to avoid situations where newly built plants result in a net decrease in electricity output following curtailment, due to the one-year delay associated with recognizing the impacts of newly built plants on available FP and on curtailment rates.

### **1.1.0 - Mar 24, 2016**

* New Components
  * A distributed generation module has been added to the Buildings and Appliances Sector.
  * Geothermal and petroleum-fired power plants have been added.
  * Natural gas power plants have been split into two types: natural gas peaker plants and natural gas non-peaker plants.
  * Electricity imports and exports have been added.
  * Implemented endogenous, capacity-based learning curves for wind, solar PV (utility-scale and distributed), batteries, and CCS.
  * Implemented new mechanism for constructing peaking power plant types (petroleum-fired and natural gas peakers).
* New Policy Levers
  * Electricity Sector: Reduce Transmission and Distribition Losses
  * Electricity Sector: Reduce Plant Downtime
  * Electricity Sector: Change Electricity Imports
  * Electricity Sector: Change Electricity Exports
  * Buildings Sector: Distributed Solar Carve-Out
  * Buildings Sector: Distributed Solar Subsidy
  * Land Use Sector: Avoid Deforestation
* Major Improvements to Existing Components
  * The Renewable Portfolio Standard policy lever is now additional to a BAU RPS level.  It uses a new phase-in mechanism that minimizes shocks for electricity suppliers to better reflect their likely behavior in response to this policy.
  * The price-based power plant early retirement mechanism has been redesigned.  It is now more realistic in situations with strong economic incentives for retirement, and it does not affect the BAU case.
  * The mechanism for determining how much capacity of each electricity source may be built in a given year has been redesigned.  It is now dependent on installed capacity only for wind and solar PV.
  * Flexibility points are no longer a hard limit on renewables construction or dispatch.  As before, renewables remain unconstrained until capacity equals flexibility points.  Thereafter, capacity factor of renewables is reduced proportionately to the overage of capacity beyond flexibility points.
  * Consolidated vehicle suppliers, building component suppliers, and industrial equipment suppliers into a single cash flow entity, "capital equipment suppliers".  The land use and forestry sector now also makes use of this new cash flow entity.
  * Updated graphs and output variables to include new power plant types and distributed generation (solar and non-solar).  Updated graph color scheme.
  * Cost outputs have been rebuilt for clarity and now have their own sheet.  Minor updates to several cash flow sheets to provide variables in the uniform format expected by the new cost outputs sheet.
  * The contract-based dispatch mechanism has been renamed the guaranteed dispatch mechanism.  The BAU version of this mechanism is now always used in the BAU case, and the control lever that used to govern this behavior has been removed.  The policy “Boolean Use Contract Based Dispatch in Policy Case” has been renamed “Boolean Use Non BAU Guaranteed Dispatch Settings” and has been modified to work analogously to “Boolean Use Non BAU Mandated Capacity Construction Schedule."
  * Added the concept of "Bid" capacity factors, which are expected or peak time capacity factors (varying by plant type).  This system increases the importance of the electricity dispatch mechanisms.  Not used for peaking plant types.
* Data Updates
  * The simulator's first calculated year has been advanced from 2013 to 2015.
  * Numerous data sources have been updated to their most current versions.
  * BAU Subsidies have been updated to account for changes in legislation.
  * The U.S. dataset no longer splits preexisting plants into "retiring" and "nonretiring" categories, to better reflect the fact that retirements in the U.S. do not correlate with specific technological or quality properties.  The model retains both of these quality tiers structurally, so that non-U.S. countries may still choose to make use of this distinction in their own datasets.
  * In the Buildings Sector, the "residential" building type has been split into "urban residential" and "rural residential".  Three policies are now subscripted by building type.
  * All three included reference scenarios (CPP, EI, CO2eMin) have been updated to still hit their emissions targets (narrowly, for CPP and EI).
  * Updated capital cost of new coal plants to include CCS, reflecting the latest regulations.
  * BAU fuel costs now rely on the EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook for values through 2016, increasing accuracy relative to the EIA Annual Energy Outlook.
* Minor Improvements
  * Future demand response capacity in the BAU case now assumes linear rather than geometric growth, in line with FERC data source.
  * Normalized Standard Deviation of New Output Costs is now a calculated variable, based on a weighted average of the Normalized Standard Dev of Dispatch Costs and the Normalized Std Dev of Capital Costs.
  * Removed the BAU Regional Support Variance Multiplier, as these effects should now be accounted for in the normalized standard deviations.
  * Added a collection of “Additional Electricity Sector Outputs” useful for examining the behavior of this sector in detail.
  * Transmission capacity across the modeled region border now contributes to flexibility points.
  * Added variable specifying the fraction of vehicles sold within the model boundary.  Those transportation policies that do not affect vehicles sold outside the modeled region now scale down their effects in proportion to the fraction of vehicles not sold within the region.
  * In the Industry Sector, induced emissions beyond the model boundary (due to leakage) are no longer included in the modeled emissions total.  Leaked emissions are now only reported as a separate variable.
  * The graph on the Buildings sector page now shows total CO2 emissions from the sector (summed across all three building types).
  * Simplified input data calculations for various electricity plant properties (such as heat rates and expected capacity factors).
  * Changed the names of many policies to remove " by End Year" and " in End Year" (which was a hold-over from before the simulator possessed a policy implementation schedule).
  * In web app support sheet, "Billion Dollars" changed to "Output Currency Unit" and now draws from a .csv file, to aid in internationalization.
  * Updated the default set of variables specified in OutputVarsToExport.lst for Python script users.
  * The control lever "Boolean Use Twenty Year GWP Values" now pulls data from a .csv file rather than being set in Vensim like a policy lever.
  * The BAU and Policy Case dispatch priorities and dispatch percentages now guarantee that natural gas peakers and petroleum-fired power plants will dispatch at their expected capacity factors.
  * Renamed Non Hydro Storage to Battery Storage (to reflect the cost input data being used in the model).
  * Biomass is now a value Buildings Sector fuel.
* Bug Fixes
  * Corrected input data for BAU amount and potential amount of CCS.
  * Corrected flexibility point and transmission connectivity coefficient calculations.

* Simplified structure for calculating carbon taxes and revenue-neutral carbon tax package costs
* Expanded acronym-key.xlsx with an "About" tab containing general information and a key to the folders at the root of the InputData folder
* "BAU New Cargo Dist Transported" now automatically uses input data when available and otherwise uses a lifetime-based estimate
* Updated input data for "BAU Capacity Retirements before Price Effects" to reflect actual power plant retirements in years 2013-2015
* Defined default colors for lines and stacked areas in Vensim-based electricity and cash-flow-by-entity graphs

### **1.0.1 - Oct 30, 2015**

* Added calculation of amount of carbon taxes paid on fuel, on process emissions, and total
* Added new cost outputs for the main two cost metrics (change in capital fuel and labor expenditures; total change in outlays) using the revenue-neutral carbon tax assumption
* Added web app support versions of the two new cost outputs.  Updated GraphDefinitions.vgd and WebAppData.xlsx accordingly.
* Added a new column to acronym-key.xlsx (in InputData) specifying the relative priority of replacing the data for each variable when adapting the model to a new country or region

### **1.0.0 - Oct 20, 2015**

* Initial Release
